    "text": "2. There is no causation without manipulation.\nThe “counterfactual” definition of causality requires one to be able to think through what outcomes may result in different conditions. How would things look if one party as opposed to another was elected? Everyday causal statements often fall short of this requirement in one of two ways.\n\nFirst, some statements do not specify clear counterfactual conditions. For example the claim that “the recession was caused by Wall Street” does not point to an obvious counterfactual— are we to consider whether there would have been a recession if Wall Street did not exist? Or is the statement really a statement about particular actions that Wall Street could have taken but did not. If so, which actions? The validity of such statements is hard to assess, and can depend on which counterfactual conditions are implied by a statement.\nSecond, some statements involve counterfactual conditions that cannot be imagined. For example, the claim that Peter got the job because he is Peter implies a consideration of what would have happened if Peter was not Peter. Alternatively, the claim that Peter got the job because he is a man requires considering Peter as other than a man. The problem is that the counterfactuals in these cases imply a change not just in the condition facing an individual but in the individual themselves.\n\nTo avoid such problems, some statisticians urge a restriction of causal claims to treatments that can conceivably (not necessarily practically) be manipulated.3 For example, while we might have difficulties with the claim that Peter got the job because he was a man, we have no such difficulties with the claim that Peter got the job because the hiring agency thought he was a man.\n\n\n3. Causes are non-rival.\nEven though we may focus on the effect of a single cause \\(X\\) on an outcome \\(Y\\), we generally do not expect that there is ever only a single cause of \\(Y\\).4 Moreover, if you add up the causal effects of different causes, there is no reason to expect them to add up to 100%. Hence, there is not much point trying to “apportion” outcomes to different causal factors. In other words, causes are not rival. The National Rifle Association argues, for example, that guns don’t kill people, people kill people. That statement does not make much sense in the counterfactual framework. Take away guns and you have no deaths from gunshot wounds. So guns are a cause. Take away people and you also have no deaths from gunshot wounds, so people are also a cause. Put differently, these two factors are simultaneously causes of the same outcomes.\n\n\n4. \\(X\\) can cause \\(Y\\) even if \\(X\\) is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for \\(Y\\).\nWe often talk about causal relations in deterministic terms. Even the Lewis quote at the top of this page seems to suggest a deterministic relation between causes and effects. Sometimes causal relations are thought to entail necessary conditions (for \\(Y\\) to occur, \\(X\\) has to happen); sometimes such relations are thought to entail sufficient conditions (if \\(X\\) occurs, then \\(Y\\) occurs). But once we are talking about multiple units, there are at least two ways in which we can think of \\(X\\) causing \\(Y\\) even if \\(X\\) is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for \\(Y\\). The first is to reinterpret everything in probabilistic terms: by \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\), we simply mean that the probability of \\(Y\\) is higher when \\(X\\) is present. Another is to allow for contingencies — for example, \\(X\\) may cause \\(Y\\) if condition \\(Z\\) is present, but not otherwise.5\n\n\n5. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference.\nIf causal effects are statements about the difference between what happened and what could have happened, then causal effects cannot be measured. That’s bad news. Prospectively, you can arrange things so that you can observe either what happens if someone gets a treatment or what happens if they do not get the treatment. Yet, for the same person, you will never be able to observe both of these outcomes and hence also not the difference between them. This inability to observe unit-level causal effects is often called the “fundamental problem of causal inference.”\n\n\n6. You can estimate average causal effects even though you cannot observe any individual causal effects.\nEven though you cannot observe whether \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) for any given unit, it can still be possible to figure out whether \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) on average. The key insight here is that the average causal effect equals the difference between the average outcome across all units if all units were in the control condition and the average outcome across all units if all units were in the treatment condition. Many strategies for causal identification (see 10 Strategies for Figuring Out If X Caused Y) focus on ways to learn about these average potential outcomes.6\n10 Things to Know About Hypothesis Testing describes how one can learn about individual causal effects rather than average causal effects given the fundamental problem of causal inference.\n\n\n7. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical.\nOne strategy that people use to learn about average causal effects is to create treatment and control groups through randomization (see 10 Strategies for Figuring Out If X Caused Y). When doing so, researchers sometimes worry if they find that the resulting treatment and control groups do not look the same along relevant dimensions.\nThe good news is that the argument for why differences in average outcomes across randomly assigned treatment and control groups capture average treatment effects (in expectation across repeated randomizations within the same pool of units) does not rely on treatment and control groups being similar in their observed characteristics. It relies only on the idea that, on average, the outcomes in the treated and control groups will capture the average outcomes for all units in the experimental pool if they were, respectively, in treatment or in control. In practice actual treatment and control groups will not be identical.7\n\n\n8. Correlation is not causation.\nA correlation between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is a statement about relations between actual outcomes in the world, not about the relation between actual outcomes and counterfactual outcomes. So statements about causes and correlations don’t have much to do with each other. Positive correlations can be consistent with positive causal effects, no causal effects, or even negative causal effects. For example taking cough medication is positively correlated with coughing but hopefully has a negative causal effect on coughing.8\n\n\n9. If you know that, on average, \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) causes \\(C\\), this does not mean that, on average, \\(A\\) causes \\(C\\).\nYou might expect that if \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) causes \\(C\\) that therefore \\(A\\) causes \\(C\\).9 But there is no reason to believe that average causal relations are transitive in this way. To see why, imagine \\(A\\) caused \\(B\\) for men but not women and \\(B\\) caused \\(C\\) for women but not men. Then on average \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) causes \\(C\\) but there may still be no one for whom \\(A\\) causes \\(C\\) through \\(B\\).\n\n\n10. It’s easier to learn about the “effects of causes” than to learn about the “causes of effects.”\nThough it might sound like two ways of saying the same thing, there is a difference between understanding what the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is (the “effects of a cause”) and whether an outcome \\(Y\\) was due to cause \\(X\\) (the “cause of an effect”).10 Consider the following example. Suppose we run an experiment with a sample that contains an equal number of men and women. The experiment randomly assigns men and women to a binary treatment \\(X\\) and measures a binary outcome \\(Y\\). Further, suppose that \\(X\\) has a positive effect of 1 for all men, i.e. men’s control potential outcome is zero (\\(Y_i(0) = 0\\)) and their treated potential outcome is one (\\(Y_i(1) = 1\\)). For all women, \\(X\\) has a negative effect of \\(-1\\), i.e., women’s control potential outcome is one (\\(Y_i(0) = 1\\)) and their treated potential outcome is zero (\\(Y_i(1) = 0\\)). In this example, the average effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) is zero. But for all participants in the treatment group with \\(Y=1\\), it is the case that \\(Y=1\\) because \\(X=1\\). Similarly, for all participants in the treatment group with \\(Y=0\\), it is the case that \\(Y=0\\) because \\(X=1\\). Experimentation can get an exact answer to the question about the “effects of a cause”, but generally it is not possible to get an exact answer to the question about the “cause of an effect”.11\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nOriginating author: Macartan Humphreys.

Under this account, a cause may be an Insufficient but Necessary part of a condition which is itself Unnecessary but Sufficient.

    "title": "10 Things to Know About Adaptive Experimental Design",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2. What are the potential advantages of an adaptive design?\nAdaptive designs have the potential to detect the best-performing experimental arm(s) more quickly than a static design (i.e., with fewer data-collection sessions and fewer subjects). When these efficiencies are realized, resources may be reallocated to achieve other research objectives.\nAdaptive designs also have the potential to lessen the ethical concerns that arise when subjects are allocated to inferior treatment arms. For therapeutic interventions, adaptive designs may reduce subjects’ exposure to inferior treatments; for interventions designed to further broad societal objectives, adaptive designs may hasten the discovery of superior interventions.\nTo illustrate the potential advantages of adaptive design, we simulate an RCT involving a control group and eight treatment arms. We administer treatments and gather 100 outcomes during each “period.” The simulation assumes that each subject’s outcome is binary (e.g., good versus bad). The adaptive allocation of subjects is based on interim analyses conducted at the end of each period. We allocate next period’s subjects according to posterior probabilities that a given treatment arm is best (see below). The simulation assumes that the probability of success is 0.10 for all arms except one, which is 0.20. The stopping rule is that the RCT is halted when one arm is found to have a 95% posterior probability of being best.\nIn the adaptive trial depicted below, the best arm (the red line) is correctly identified, and the trial is halted after 23 periods (total N=2300).\n\n\n\n3. What are the potential disadvantages of adaptive designs?\nThere is no guarantee that adaptive design will be superior in terms of speed or accuracy. For example, adaptive designs may result in a lengthy trial in cases where all of the arms are approximately equally effective. Even when one arm is truly superior, adaptive searches have some probability of resulting in long, circuitous searches (and considerable expense) if by chance they get off to a bad start (i.e., one of the inferior arms appears to be better than the other based on an initial round of results).\nFor instance, consider the following scenario in which all but one of the arms have a 0.10 probability of success, and the superior arm has a 0.12 probability of success (with the same trial design as in the previous example). The design eventually settles on the truly superior arm but only after more than 200 periods (N = 23,810). Even after 50 periods, the results provide no clear sense that any of the arms is superior.\n\nA further disadvantage of adaptive designs is they may produce biased estimates of the average treatment effect of the apparent best arm vis-à-vis the control group. Bias arises because the trial stops when the best arm crosses a threshold suggesting optimality; this stopping rule tends to favor lucky draws that suggest the efficacy of the winning arm. Conversely, when adaptive algorithms associate sampling probability with observed history, under-estimation for inferior arms, including the control group, may persist until stopping time (Nie et al., 2017).\nFor example, in the first scenario described above in which all arms have a 0.10 probability of success except for the best arm, which is 0.20, the average estimated success probability for the truly best arm is 0.202 across 1000 simulated experiments, while the control group average is found to 0.083. The average estimated difference in success probabilities (i.e., the average treatment effect) is 0.119, as compared to the true value of 0.10.\nIn the second scenario, in which the best arm’s success probability is just 0.12, the average estimated success probability for the best arm is 0.121, and the average estimated ATE is 0.027, as compared to the true ATE of 0.02. Bias in this case is relatively small on a percentage point scale due to the very large size of the average experiment.\n\n\n4. What kinds of experiments lend themselves to adaptive design?\nAdaptive designs require multiple periods of treatment and outcome assessment.\nAdaptive designs are well suited to survey, on-line, and lab experiments, where participants are treated and outcomes measured in batches over time.\nSome field experiments are conducted in stages, although the logistics of changing treatment arms may be cumbersome, as discussed below. One possible opportunity for adaptive design in a field context occurs when a given experiment is to be deployed over time in a series of different regions. This allows for adaptation based on region-by-region interim analyses.\nAdaptive designs are ill-suited to one-shot interventions with outcomes measured at a single point in time. For example, experiments designed to increase voter turnout in a given election do not lend themselves to adaptive design because everyone’s outcome is measured at the same time, leaving no opportunity for adaptation.\n\n\n5. What is the connection between adaptive designs and “multi-arm bandit problems”?\nThe multi-arm bandit problem (Scott 2010) is a metaphor for the following optimization problem. Imagine that you could drop a coin in one of several slot machines that may pay off at different rates. (Slot machines are sometimes nicknamed “one-arm bandits,” hence the name.) You would like to make as much money as possible. The optimization problem may be characterized as a trade off between learning about the relative merits of the various slot machines – exploration – and reaping the benefits of employing the best arm – exploitation. A static design may be viewed as an extreme case of allocating subjects solely for exploration.\nAs applied to RCTs, the aim is to explore the merits of the various treatment arms while at the same time reaping the benefits of the best arm or arms. Although the MAB problem is not specifically about estimating treatment effects, one could adjust the optimization objective so that the aim is to find the treatment arm with the greatest apparent superiority over the control group.\n\n\n6. What are some widely used algorithms for automating “adaptation”?\nThe most commonly used methods employ some form of “Thompson sampling” (Thompson 1933). Interim results are assessed periodically, and in the next period subjects are assigned to treatment arms in proportion to the posterior probability that a given arm is best. The more likely an arm is to be “best,” the more subjects it receives.\nMany variations on this basic assignment routine have been proposed, and some are designed to make it less prone to bias. If an adaptive trial is rolled out during a period in which success rates tend to be growing, increasing allocation of subjects to the best arm will tend to exaggerate that arm’s efficacy relative to the other arms, which receive fewer subjects during the high-yield period. In order to assess bias and correct for it, it may be useful to allocate some subjects in every period according to a static design. In this case, inverse probability weights for each period may be used to obtain unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. (See Gerber and Green 2012 on the use of inverse probability weights for estimation of average treatment effects when the probability of assignment varies from block to block.)\n\n\n7. What are the symptoms of futile search?\nAlthough it is impossible to know for sure whether a drawn out search reflects an unlucky start or an underlying reality in which no arm is superior, the longer an adaptive trial goes, the more cause for concern. The following graphs summarize the distribution of stopping times for three scenarios. Stopping was dictated by at 10% value remaining criterion. Specifically, the trial stopped when the top of the 95% confidence interval showed that no other arm was likely to offer at least a 10 percent (not percentage point) gain in success rate. The first two scenarios were described above; the third scenario considers a case in which there are two superior arms. The graph illustrates how adaptive trials tend to conclude faster when the superiority of the best arm(s) is more clear-cut.\n\n\n\n8. What implications do adaptive designs have for pre-analysis plans?\nThe use of adaptive designs introduces additional decisions, which ideally should be addressed ex ante so as to limit researcher bias. For example, the researcher should specify which algorithms will be used for allocation. It is especially important to specify the stopping rule. Depending on the researcher’s objectives, this rule may focus on achieving a desired posterior probability, or it may use a “value remaining” criterion that considers whether one or more arms have shown themselves to be good enough vis-à-vis the alternative arms. Other hybrid stopping criteria may also be specified. The pre-analysis plan should also describe the analytic steps that will be taken to correct for bias.\n\n\n9. Are multi-arm bandit trials frequently used in social science?\nMany of the applications to date have taken place in commercial settings, such as website design for high-volume e-commerce, or in settings such as on-line fundraising. Relatively few applications have been written up in detail for a scholarly audience. Surprisingly rare are applications in biomedical research. As Villar et al. (2015, p.200) note, “Despite this apparent near-perfect fit between a real-world problem and a mathematical theory, the MABP has yet to be applied to an actual clinical trial.”\nPutting aside the use of multi-arm bandit approaches, the use of adaptive trials is gradually winning acceptance in biomedical research. For details, see Chin (2016).\n\n\n10. What other considerations should inform the decision to use adaptive design?\nAs noted above, adaptive designs add to the complexity of the research design and analysis. They also may increase the challenges of implementation, particularly in field settings where the logistical or training costs associated with different arms vary markedly. Even when one arm is clearly superior (inferior), the lead-time necessary to staff or outfit this arm may make it difficult to scale it up (down). Adaptive designs are only practical if adaptation is feasible.\nOn the other hand, funders and implementation partners may welcome the idea of an experimental design that responds to on-the-ground conditions such that problematic arms are scaled back. A middle ground between static designs and designs that envision adaptation over many periods are adaptive designs involving only two or three interim analyses and adjustments. Such trials are winning increased acceptance in biomedical research (Chow and Chang 2008) and are likely to become more widely used in the social sciences too. The growing interest in replication and design-based extensions of existing experiments to aid generalization are likely to create opportunities for adaptive design.\n\n\nReferences\nChin, Richard. 2016.

    "title": "10 Things You Need to Know About Statistical Power",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 What Power Is\nPower is the ability to distinguish signal from noise.\nThe signal that we are interested in is the impact of a treatment on some outcome. Does education increase incomes? Do public health campaigns decrease the incidence of disease? Can international monitoring decrease government corruption?\nThe noise that we are concerned about comes from the complexity of the world. Outcomes vary across people and places for myriad reasons. In statistical terms, you can think of this variation as the standard deviation of the outcome variable. For example, suppose an experiment uses rates of a rare disease as an outcome. The total number of affected people isn’t likely to fluctuate wildly day to day, meaning that the background noise in this environment will be low. When noise is low, experiments can detect even small changes in average outcomes. A treatment that decreased the incidence of the disease by 1% percentage points would be easily detected, because the baseline rates are so constant.\nNow suppose an experiment instead used subjects’ income as an outcome variable. Incomes can vary pretty widely – in some places, it is not uncommon for people to have neighbors that earn two, ten, or one hundred times their daily wages. When noise is high, experiments have more trouble. A treatment that increased workers’ incomes by 1% would be difficult to detect, because incomes differ by so much in the first place.\nA major concern before embarking on an experiment is the danger of a false negative. Suppose the treatment really does have a causal impact on outcomes. It would be a shame to go to all the trouble and expense of randomizing the treatment, collecting data on both treatment and control groups, and analyzing the results, just to have the effect be overwhelmed by background noise.\nIf our experiments are highly-powered, we can be confident that if there truly is a treatment effect, we’ll be able to see it.\n\n\n2 Why You Need It\nExperimenters often guard against false positives with statistical significance tests. After an experiment has been run, we are concerned about falsely concluding that there is an effect when there really isn’t.\nPower analysis asks the opposite question: supposing there truly is a treatment effect and you were to run your experiment a huge number of times, how often will you get a statistically significant result?\nAnswering this question requires informed guesswork. You’ll have to supply guesses as to how big your treatment effect can reasonably be, how many subjects will answer your survey, how many subjects your organization can realistically afford to treat.\nWhere do these guesses come from? Before an experiment is run, there is often a wealth of baseline data that are available. How old/rich/educated are subjects like yours going to be? How big was the biggest treatment effect ever established for your dependent variable? With power analysis, you can see how sensitive the probability of getting significant results is to changes in your assumptions.\nMany disciplines have settled on a target power value of 0.80. Researchers will tweak their designs and assumptions until they can be confident that their experiments will return statistically significant results 80% of the time. While this convention is a useful benchmark, be sure that you are comfortable with the risks associated with an 80% expected success rate.\nA note of caution: power matters a lot. Negative results from underpowered studies can be hard to interpret: Is there really no effect? Or is the study just not able to figure it out? Positive results from an underpowered study can also be misleading: conditional upon being statistically significant, an estimate from an underpowered study probably overestimates treatment effects. Under powered studies are sometimes based on overly optimistic assumptions; a convincing power analysis makes these assumptions explicit and should protect you from implementing designs that realistically have no chance of answering the questions you want to answer.\n\n\n3 The Three Ingredients of Statistical Power\nThere are three big categories of things that determine how highly powered your experiment will be. The first two (the strength of the treatment and background noise) are things that you can’t really control – these are the realities of your experimental environment. The last, the experimental design, is the only thing that you have power over – use it!\n\nStrength of the treatment. As the strength of your treatment increases, the power of your experiment increases. This makes sense: if your treatment were giving every subject $1,000,000, there is little doubt that we could discern differences in behavior between the treatment and control groups. Many times, however, we are not in control of the strength of our treatments. For example, researchers involved in program evaluation don’t get to decide what the treatment should be, they are supposed to evaluate the program as it is.\nBackground noise. As the background noise of your outcome variables increases, the power of your experiment decreases. To the extent that it is possible, try to select outcome variables that have low variability. In practical terms, this means comparing the standard deviation of the outcome variable to the expected treatment effect size — there is no magic ratio that you should be shooting for, but the closer the two are, the better off your experiment will be. By and large, researchers are not in control of background noise, and picking lower-noise outcome variables is easier said than done. Furthermore, many outcomes we would like to study are inherently quite variable. From this perspective, background noise is something you just have to deal with as best you can.\nExperimental Design. Traditional power analysis focuses on one (albeit very important) element of experimental design: the number of subjects in each experimental group. Put simply, a larger number of subjects increases power. However, there are other elements of the experimental design that can increase power: how is the randomization conducted? Will other factors be statistically controlled for? How many treatment groups will there be, and can they be combined in some analyses?\n\n\n\n4 Key Formulas for Calculating Power\nStatisticians have derived formulas for calculating the power of many experimental designs. They can be useful as a back of the envelope calculation of how large a sample you’ll need. Be careful, though, because the assumptions behind the formulas can sometimes be obscure, and worse, they can be wrong.\nHere is a common formula used to calculate power2\n\\[\\beta = \\Phi \\left(\\frac{|\\mu_t-\\mu_c|\\sqrt{N}}{2\\sigma}-\\Phi^{-1} \\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right)\\]\n\n\\(\\beta\\) is our measure of power. Because it’s the probability of getting a statistically significant result, β will be a number between 0 and 1.\n\\(\\Phi\\) is the CDF of the normal distribution, and \\(\\Phi^{-1}\\) is its inverse. Everything else in this formula, we have to plug in:\n\\(\\mu_t\\) is the average outcome in the treatment group. Suppose it’s 65.\n\\(\\mu_c\\) is the average outcome in the control group. Suppose it’s 60.\nTogether, assumptions about μt and μc define our assumption about the size of the treatment effect: 65-60= 5.\n\\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of outcomes. This is how we make assumptions about how noisy our experiment will be — one of the assumptions we’re making is that sigma is the same for both the treatment and control groups. Suppose \\(\\sigma=20\\)\n\\(\\alpha\\) is our significance level – the convention in many disciplines is that α should be equal to 0.05. \\(N\\) is the total number of subjects. This is the only variable that is under the direct control of the researcher. This formula assumes that every subject had a 50/50 chance of being in control. Suppose that \\(N=500\\).\n\nWorking through the formula, we find that under this set of assumptions, \\(β = 0.80\\), meaning that we have an 80% chance of recovering a statistically significant result with this design. Click here for a google spreadsheet that includes this formula. You can copy these formulas directly into Excel. If you’re comfortable in R, here is code that will accomplish the same calculation.\n\npower_calculator <- function(mu_t, mu_c, sigma, alpha=0.05, N){ \n  lowertail <- (abs(mu_t - mu_c)*sqrt(N))/(2*sigma) \n  uppertail <- -1*lowertail \n  beta <- pnorm(lowertail- qnorm(1-alpha/2), lower.tail=TRUE) + 1- pnorm(uppertail- qnorm(1-alpha/2), lower.tail=FALSE) \n  return(beta) \n  } \n\n\n\n5 When to Believe Your Power Analysis\nFrom some perspectives the whole idea of power analysis makes no sense. You want to figure out the size of some treatment effect but first you need to do a power analysis which requires that you already know your treatment effect and a lot more besides.\nSo in most power analyses you are in fact seeing what happens with numbers that are to some extent made up. The good news is that it is easy to find out how much your conclusions depend on your assumptions: simply vary your assumptions and see how the conclusions on power vary.\nThis is most easily seen by thinking about how power varies with the number of subjects. A power analysis that looks at power for different study sizes simply plugs in a range of values in for N and seeing how β changes.\nUsing the formula in section 4, you can see how sensitive power is to all of the assumptions: Power will be higher if you assume the treatment effect will be larger, or if you’re willing to accept a higher alpha level, or if you have more or less confidence in the noisiness of your measures.3\n\n\n\n\n6 How to Use Simulation to Estimate Power\nPower is a measure of how often, given assumptions, we would obtain statistically significant results, if we were to conduct our experiment thousands of times. The power calculation formula takes assumptions and return an analytic solution. However, due to advances in modern computing, we don’t have to rely on analytic solutions for power analysis. We can tell our computers to literally run the experiment thousands of times and simply count how frequently our experiment comes up significant.\nThe code block below shows how to conduct this simulation in R.\n\npossible.ns <- seq(from=100, to=2000, by=40) # The sample sizes we'll be considering\nstopifnot(all( (possible.ns %% 2)==0 )) ## require even number of experimental pool\npowers <- rep(NA, length(possible.ns)) # Empty object to collect simulation estimates \nalpha <- 0.05 # Standard significance level \nsims <- 500 # Number of simulations to conduct for each N \n#### Outer loop to vary the number of subjects #### \nfor (j in 1:length(possible.ns)){ N <- possible.ns[j] # Pick the jth value for N \n  Y0 <- rnorm(n=N, mean=60, sd=20) # control potential outcome \n  tau <- 5 # Hypothesize treatment effect \n  Y1 <- Y0 + tau # treatment potential outcome                                   \n  significant.experiments <- rep(NA, sims) # Empty object to count significant experiments \n                                  \n  #### Inner loop to conduct experiments \"sims\" times over for each N #### \n        Y0 <- rnorm(n=N, mean=60, sd=20) # control potential outcome \n        tau <- 5 # Hypothesize treatment effect \n        Y1 <- Y0 + tau # treatment potential outcome \n  for (i in 1:sims){ \n        ## Z.sim <- rbinom(n=N, size=1, prob=.5) # Do a random assignment  by coin flip\n        Z.sim <- sample(rep(c(0,1),N/2)) ## Do a random assignment ensuring equal sized groups\n        Y.sim <- Y1*Z.sim + Y0*(1-Z.sim) # Reveal outcomes according to assignment \n        fit.sim <- lm(Y.sim ~ Z.sim) # Do analysis (Simple regression) \n        p.value <- summary(fit.sim)$coefficients[2,4] # Extract p-values \n        significant.experiments[i] <- (p.value <= alpha) # Determine significance according to p <= 0.05\n        }\n  powers[j] <- mean(significant.experiments) # store average success rate (power) for each N \n  } \npowers \n\n [1] 0.292 0.402 0.306 0.522 0.400 0.608 0.658 0.666 0.742 0.770 0.822 0.802\n[13] 0.884 0.894 0.912 0.884 0.900 0.934 0.956 0.976 0.944 0.970 0.972 0.984\n[25] 0.984 0.982 0.984 0.992 0.984 0.992 0.996 0.996 0.994 0.998 0.994 0.998\n[37] 1.000 0.998 0.998 0.998 1.000 0.998 0.998 0.998 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000\n\n\nThe code for this simulation and others is available here. Simulation is a far more flexible, and far more intuitive way to think about power analysis. Even the smallest tweaks to an experimental design are difficult to capture in a formula (adding a second treatment group, for example), but are relatively straightforward to include in a simulation.\nIn addition to counting up how often your experiments come up statistically significant, you can directly observe the distribution of p-values you’re likely to get. The graph below shows that under these assumptions, you can get expect to get quite a few p-values in the 0.01 range, but that 80% will be below 0.05.\n\n\n\n7 How to Change your Design to Improve Your Power\nWhen it comes to statistical power, the only thing that that’s under your control is the design of the experiment. As we’ve seen above, an obvious design choice is the number of subjects to include in the experiment. The more subjects, the higher the power.\nHowever, the number of subjects is not the only design choice that has consequences for power. There are two broad classes of design choices that are especially important in this regard.\n\nChoice of estimator. Are you using difference-in-means? Will you be doing some transformation, such as a logit or a probit? Will you be controlling for covariates? Will you be using some kind of robust standard error estimator? All of these choices will make a difference for the statistical significance of your results, and therefore for the power of your experiment. One easy way to think about this is to imagine what command you’ll be running in R or Stata after the experiment has come back; that’s your estimator!\nRandomization Protocol. What kind of randomization will you be employing? Simple randomization gives all subjects an equal probability of being in the treatment group, and then performs a (possibly weighted) coin flip for each. Complete randomization is similar, but it ensures that exactly a certain number will be assigned to treatment. Block randomization is even more powerful — it ensures that a certain number within a subgroup will be assigned to treatment. A restricted random assignment rejects some random assignments based on some set of criteria — lack of balance perhaps. These various types of random assignment can dramatically increase the power of an experiment at no extra cost. Read up on randomization protocols here.\n\nThere are too many choices to cover in this short article, but check out the Simulation for Power Analysis code page for some ways to get started. But to give a flavor of the simulation approach, consider how you would conduct a power analysis if you wanted to include covariates in your analysis.\nIf the covariates you include as control variables are strongly related to the outcome, then you’ve dramatically increased the power of your experiment.Unfortunately, the extra power that comes with including control variables is very hard to capture in a compact formula. Almost none of the power formulas found in textbooks or floating around on the internet can provide guidance on what the inclusion of covariates will do for your power.\nThe answer is simulation.\n\nSuppose we’re studying the effect of an educational intervention on income\nSuppose we have good data on the relationship between two covariates and income: age and gender. In this economy, men earn more than women, and older people earn more than younger people.\nRun a regression of income on age and gender and record the coefficients, using pre-existing survey data (better yet: use baseline data from future participants in your experiment!) *Generate fake covariate data — N total subjects, but broken up by age and gender in a way that reflects your experimental subject pool.\nGenerate fake control data — where the outcome is a function of age and gender according to your regression estimates\nHypothesize a treatment effect to generate fake treatment data\nRun the experiment 10,000 times, and record how often, using a regression with controls, your experiment turns up significant.\n\nHere’s a graph that compares the power of an experiment that does control for background attributes to one that does not. The R-square of the regression relating income to age and gender is pretty high — around .66 — meaning that the covariates that we have gathered (generated) are highly predictive. For a rough comparison, sigma, the level of background noise that the unadjusted model is dealing with, is around 33. This graph shows that at any N, the covariate-adjusted model has more power — so much so that the unadjusted model would need 1500 subjects to achieve what the covariate-adjusted model can do with 500.\n\nThis approach doesn’t rely on a formula to come up with the probability of getting a statistically significant result: it relies on brute force! And because simulation lets you specify every step of the experimental design, you do a far more nuanced power analysis than simply considering the number of subjects.\n\n\n8 Power Analysis for Multiple Treatments\nMany experiments employ multiple treatments which are compared both to each other and to a control group. This added complication changes what we mean when we say the “power” of an experiment. In the single treatment group case, power is just the probability of getting a statistically significant result. In the multiple treatment case, it can mean a variety of things: A) the probability of at least one of the treatments turning up significant, B) the probability of all the treatments turning up significant (versus control) or C) the probability that the treatments will be ranked in the hypothesized order, and that those ranks will be statistically significant.\nThis question of multiple treatment arms is related to the problem of multiple comparisons. (See our guide on this topic for more details.) Standard significance testing is based on the premise that you’re conducting a single test for statistical significance, and the p-values derived from these tests reflect the probability under the null of seeing such a larger (or larger) treatment effect. If, however, you are conducting multiple tests, this probability is no longer correct. Within a suite of tests, the probability that at least one of the tests will turn up significant even when the true effect is zero is higher, essentially because you have more attempts. A commonly cited (if not commonly used) solution is to use the Bonferroni correction: specify the number of comparisons you will be making in advance, then divide your significance level (alpha) by that number.\nIf you are going to be using a Bonferroni correction, then standard power calculators will be more complicated to use: you’ll have to specify your Bonferroni-corrected alpha levels and calculate the power of each separate comparison. To calculate the probability that all the tests are significant, multiply all the separate powers together. To calculate the probability that at least one of the tests is significant, calculate the probability that none are, then subtract from one.\nOr you can use simulation. An example of a power calculation done in R is available on the simulations page.\n\n\n9 How to Think About Power for Clustered Designs\nWhen an experiment has to assign whole groups of people to treatment rather than individually, we say that the experiment is clustered. This is common in educational experiments, where whole classrooms of children are assigned to treatment or control, or in development economics, where whole villages of individuals are assigned to treatment or control. (See our guide on cluster randomization for more details.)\nAs a general rule, clustering decreases your power. If you can avoid clustering your treatments, that is preferable for power. Unless you face concerns related to spillover, logistics, or ethics, take the variation down to the lowest level that you can.\nThe best case scenario for a cluster-level design is when which cluster a subject is in provides very little information about their outcomes. Suppose subjects were randomly assigned to clusters — the cluster wouldn’t help to predict outcomes at all. If the cluster is not predictive of the outcome, then we haven’t lost too much power to clustering.\nWhere clustering really causes trouble is when there is a strong relationship between the cluster and the outcome. To take the villages example, suppose that some villages are, as a whole, much richer than others. Then the clusters might be quite predictive of educational attainment. Clustering can reduce your effective sample size from the total number of individuals to the total number of clusters.\nThere are formulas that can help you understand the consequences of clustering — see Gelman/Hill page 447-449 for an extended discussion. While these formulas can be useful, they can also be quite cumbersome to work with. The core insight however is a simple one: you generally get more power from increasing the number of clusters than you do from increasing the number of subjects within clusters. Better to have 100 clusters with 10 subjects in each than 10 clusters with 100 subjects in each.\nAgain, a more flexible approach to power analysis when dealing with clusters is simulation. See the (Declare Design library for block and cluster randomized experiments)[https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/reference/block_cluster_two_arm_designer.html] for some starter code. The (DeclareDesign)[https://declaredesign.org] software aims to make simulations for power analysis (among many other tasks) easier. See also Gelman/Hill page 450-453 for another simulation approach.\n\n\n10 Good Power Analysis Makes Preregistration Easy\nWhen you deal with power you focus on what you cannot control (noise) and what you can control (design). If you use the simulation approach to power analysis then you will be forced to imagine how your data will look and how you will handle it when it comes in. You will get a chance to specify all of your hunches and best guesses in advance, so that you can launch your experiments with clear expectations of what they can and cannot show. That’s some work but the good news is that if you really do it you are most of the way to putting together a comprehensive and registerable pre-analysis plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nOriginating author: Alex Coppock, 20 Nov 2013.
