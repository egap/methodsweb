Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) is a global research, evaluation, and learning network that promotes rigorous knowledge accumulation, innovation, and evidence-based policy in various governance and accountability domains.

**Our methods resources are aimed at learners and teachers of all levels. Guides are for self-learning, and our coursebook is for teachers of impact evaluation methods.**

Over the past decade, Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) has organized Learning Days workshops with the aim of building experimental social-science research capacity among principal investigators (PIs) – both researchers and practitioners – in Africa and Latin America. By sharing the practical and statistical methods of randomized field experiments with workshop participants, the Learning Days effort hopes to identify and nurture researcher networks around the world and to create strong, productive connections between these researchers and EGAP members. **The Learning Days Book**, which grew out of a desire to share the materials we developed for the Learning Days, is a comprehensive overview of causal inference methods for researchers developing an experimental research design.
