    <td style="vertical-align: top;"><b>The Theory and Practice and of Field Experiments</b> book is a comprehensive overview of causal inference methods for researchers developing an experimental research design. It is organized in modules and covers topics such as causal inference, randomization, hypothesis testing, estimands, estimators, statistical power, measurement, threats to internal validity, and the ethics of experimentation. The modules appear in the order the Learning Days instructors have found most useful. However, the modules are linked to one another and can be reordered to suit your needs as an instructor. In the appendix, we include some course preliminaries including a glossary of terms and an introduction to R and RStudio.</td>
