title: "Teaching impact evaluation"
---

EGAP seeks to improve methods for rigorous impact evaluation throughout the social and behavioral science research community, as well as to make existing methods accessible to a wider audience. EGAP members and staff have developed teaching materials for three audiences: learners, who wish to work at their own pace using course materials; teachers of academic courses; and teachers of EGAP's Learning Days short courses on impact evaluation. These resources are assembled below.

    <td style="vertical-align: top;"><b>The Theory and Practice and of Field Experiments</b> book is a comprehensive overview of causal inference methods for researchers developing an experimental research design. It is organized in modules and covers topics such as causal inference, randomization, hypothesis testing, estimands, estimators, statistical power, measurement, threats to internal validity, and the ethics of experimentation. The modules appear in the order the Learning Days instructors have found most useful. However, the modules are linked to one another and can be reordered to suit your needs as an instructor. In the appendix, we include some course preliminaries including a glossary of terms and an introduction to R and RStudio.</td>
