	abstract     = {We develop a new method for blocking in randomized experiments that works for an arbitrary number of treatments. We analyze the following prob- lem: given a threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained in a block, and given a distance measure between any two units in the finite population, block the units so that the maximum distance between any two units within a block is minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design. Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem. However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of estimators for sample average treatment effects under the Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.},

		The present study investigated the effect of covert modeling in reducing snake avoidance. Covert modeling requires the subject to imagine a model rather than to observe a live or film model.

		Similarity of the covert model to the avoidant subject was examined in a 2×2 design combining two levels of fear-irrelevant model similarity (model of same age and sex as the subject versus model who was much older and of opposite sex) and fear-relevant model similarity (coping versus mastery model).

		In two sessions, subjects imagined scenes in which the covert model interacted with the feared stimulus. A no-model control group, which imagined fear-related scenes in the absence of a model, was included in the design. Fear-irrelevant similarity contributed reliably to avoidance reduction. A behavioral measure of avoidance and self-report measures of affect and attitudes indicated that imagination of a model similar in age and same sexed led to greater changes than a model dissimilar on these dimensions. Fear-relevant similarity led to few reliable changes in avoidance.

		The greatest vicarious learning tended to occur in subjects who imagined a model similar in fear-related and nonfear-related dimensions. The results were found at posttreatment and at a 2- to 3-week follow-up.

Despite extensive research on social contact, observational studies are difficult to interpret because prejudiced people may select out of contact with out-group members.We overcome this problem by conducting an education-based, randomized field experiment—the Urban Youth Vocational Training program (UYVT)—with 849 randomly sampled Christian and Muslim young men in riot-prone Kaduna, Nigeria. After sixteen weeks of positive intergroup social contact, we find no changes in prejudice, but heterogeneous-class subjects discriminate significantly less against out-group members than subjects in homogeneous classes.We trace this finding to increased discrimination by homogeneous-class subjects compared to non-UYVT study participants, and we highlight potentially negative consequences of in-group social contact. By focusing on skill-building instead of peace messaging, our intervention minimizes reporting bias and offers strong experimental evidence that intergroup social contact can alter behavior in constructive ways, even amid violent conflict.}

		Arguing that causal process/mechanism is part of people's thoughts about causation.

		I say, sure.  But do we need to SEE a causal process, or do we just come up with a causal process when we notice things covarying?  Given the massive amount of times humans have been wrong about causal relationships (home ownership causes good citizens anyone?), it seems like we come up with causal processes ourselves...also, how else could we do it?   We can only perceive, never know, the truth.

Entertainment media offers a unique and cost-effective channel of reaching millions of viewers with financial education messages that resonate. This paper uses random and symmetric encouragement methodology to study the economic impact of targeted messages on debt management and gambling scripted in a popular television soap opera in South Africa. The results show treated viewers score significantly higher on financial knowledge, are more likely to borrow from formal sources and for productive purposes, and are less likely to enter into retail credit or gamble. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of mechanisms show strong recall of messages conveyed by the lead character, which supports theories of psychological and emotional influences on decision-making.

However, little is known about the relative strengths of the generalization of negative and positive interpersonal attitudes into attitudes about the outgroup. The unique contribution of negative (disliking) interpersonal attitudes to intergroup attitudes was examined and its strength was compared with the effect of positive (liking) interpersonal attitudes, using cross-sectional (Study 1; N = 733, age 10-12) and longitudinal data (Study 2; N = 960, age 12-13). Disliking uniquely contributed to respondents’ outgroup attitudes. The generalization of interpersonal liking and disliking was about equally strong in both studies. This underpins the importance of examining the effects of both positive and negative intergroup contact experiences on the formation of outgroup attitudes.}

		Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r =−.21). Allport’s original conditions for optimal contact – equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction – facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions.

		There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions.

		These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal – across nations, genders, and age groups.

		The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice – vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs – especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed.

Depending on the condition, the decision rules were such that the proposition allegedly passed or failed. The degree of threat of the group was varied by informing participants that the group represented a small (4%) or substantial (40%) proportion of the population living in the area. Consistent with the Group Attribution Error literature, the outcome of the vote influenced participants’ inferences about the extremity of the voters’ attitude. More positive (negative) attitudes were inferred in the case of a positive (negative) outcome of the vote. This effect was qualified by the level of threat. Participants inferred relatively more extreme and more homogeneous attitudes among the members of a threatening group."}

The MIP-G model postulates that social motivation drives the kind of information group members attend to, encode, and retrieve and that epistemic motivation drives the degree to which new information is sought and attended to, encoded, and retrieved. Social motivation and epistemic motivation are expected to influence, alone and in combination, generating problem solutions, disseminating information, and negotiating joint decisions. The MIP-G model integrates the influence of many individual and situational differences and combines insight on human thinking with group-level interaction process and decision making.}

Although no other concept is invoked more frequently in the social sciences, we still know little about how social norms are formed, the forces determining their content, and the cognitive and emotional requirements that enable a species to establish and enforce social norms. In recent years, there has been substantial progress, however, on how cooperation norms are enforced. Here we review evidence showing that sanctions are decisive for norm enforcement, and that they are largely driven by nonselfish motives. Moreover, the explicit study of sanctioning behavior provides instruments for measuring social norms and has also led to deeper insights into the proximate and ultimate forces behind human cooperation}

Our results indicate that this holds true even if punishment is costly and does not provide any material benefits for the pun isher. In addition, we provide evidence that free-riders are punished the more heavily the more they deviate from the cooperation levels of the cooperators. Potential free-riders, there fore, can avoid or at least reduce punishment by increasing their cooperation levels. This, in turn, suggests that in the presence of punish ment opportunities there will be less free riding}

We conducted a randomized controlled trial in urban Nigeria where young viewers were exposed to Shuga or to a non-educational TV series. Among those who watched Shuga, we created additional variation in the social messagesthey received and in the people with whom they watched the show. We nd signicant improvements in knowledge and attitudes towards HIV and risky sexual behavior. Treated subjects are twice as likely to get tested for HIV 6 to 9 months after the intervention. We also nd reductions in STDs among women. Our experimental manipulations of the social norm component did not produce signicantly di¤erent results from the main treatment. Also, we dont detect signicant spillovers on the behavior of friends who did not watch Shuga. The informatione¤ect of edutainment thus seems to have prevailed in the context of our study.}

We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as belonging to one's own category. This study tested these two approaches using three influence paradigms. First we demonstrate that, in Sherifs (1936) autokinetic effect paradigm, the impact of confederates on the formation of a norm decreases as their membership of a different category is made more salient to subjects. Second, in the Asch (1956) conformity paradigm, surveillance effectively exerrs normative pressure ifdone by an in-group but not by an out-group. In-group influence decreases and out-group influence increases when subjects respond privately. Self-report data indicate that in-groupconfederates create more subjective uncertainty than out-group confederates and public responding seems to increase cohesiveness with in-group - but decrease it with out-group - sources of influence. In our third experiment we use the group polarization paradigm (e.g. Bumstein & Vinokur, 1973) to demonstrate that, when categorical differences between two subgroups within a discussion group are made salient, convergence of opinion between the subgroups is inhibited. Taken together the experiments show that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence}

All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.}

These findings were replicated and extended in Experiment 2 (N = 138), where it was established that enhanced efforts only emerge when people consider the way they are evaluated by others as diagnostic for their position in the group. In addition, it is demonstrated that whereas the efforts of respected people were primarily motivated by affective commitment to the group (group-focused concerns), the behavior of disrespected people was driven by anxiety about their acceptance into the group (self-focused concerns)}

If the dialogue prompted by a mass media programme is central to understanding media effects, what forms this dialogue, and how does it influence people to change their thinking and actions? These questions formed the basis of the present investigation, which examined an entertainment-education (E-E) programme in India, developed with the intention of promoting pro-social change (e.g., gender equality, family planning, etc.). We discovered that internal dialogue (parasocial interaction) between listeners and media characters lead to conversations about the educational content of the media programme that fuelled support for social stability and for prosocial change. Second, interpersonal dialogue within families, and dialogue at the group level among community members, facilitated discussion of sensitive or taboo subjects in ways that were supportive of social stability as well as social change in family and community dynamics. Finally, listeners and viewers of E-E programmes confronted powerful forces of resistance as they attempted to change community power dynamics. Despite these difficulties, our findings suggest that synergistic possibilities for social action emerge when E-E broadcasts disseminate pro-social models of behaviour that spark various forms of dialogue among audience members}

Through facilitated sessions, the program sparked critical thinking and open dialogue among participants. This article measures the program’s effectiveness based on a sample of 462 participants and 453 nonparticipants. The results show that the program was successful in producing changes in three of the underlying structural factors of HIV: gender attitudes, gender roles, and HIV stigma. The program was also successful in changing other factors associated with HIV infection, including HIV prevention knowledge, discussion of HIV between sex partners, and having multiple sex partners.}

However, as altruistic norm compliance and norm enforcement often emerge in the context of inter-group conflicts13,14, they are likely to be shaped by parochialism15—a preference for favouring the members of one’s ethnic, racial or language group. We have conducted punishment experiments16, which allow ‘impartial’ observers to punish norm violators, with indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that these experiments confirm the prediction of parochialism. We found that punishers protect ingroup victims—who suffer from a norm violation—much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless of the norm violator’s group affiliation. Norm violators also expect that punishers will be lenient if the latter belong to their social group. As a consequence, norm violations occur more often if the punisher and the norm violator belong to the same group. Our results are puzzling for evolutionary multi-level selection theories based on selective group extinction2–5 as well as for theories of individual selection17–19; they also indicate the need to explicitly examine the interactions between individuals stemming from different groups in evolutionary models.}

Survey data from fifteen Minnesota communities experiencing conflicts of varying magnitude indicate that as level of conflict about local issues increases, the knowledge gap actually tends to decline.

In the simulation condition, participants imagined life on an alien planet that inadvertently simulated situational constraints parallel to those faced by homosexuals. The simulation (vs. control lecture) produced significantly more intergroup perspective-taking, empathy, and favorable attitudes toward homosexuals and marginalized groups. Tests of a structural equation model supported the assumption that the simulation (vs. control) provided an experience that heightened intergroup perspective-taking, which indirectly predicted favorable attitudes via independent cognitive (inclusive intergroup representations) and affective (empathy) paths. The model held after statistically controlling for prior attitudes and ideological individual differences predicting anti-homosexual bias. Implications for prejudice-reduction simulations and intergroup contact are considered.}

Study 1 shows that both pride and respect are significantly related to self-esteem and group-oriented behaviors in a study based upon people's self-identification with important groups and social categories. Study 2 replicates the same relationships in a context (campus sororities) in which distinctions between and within groups are especially salient and important.

In Study 1, role modeling affected individual-level outcomes: it increased perceived collective efficacy and willingness to take action, but exacerbated intergroup attitudes and reduced tolerance. Study 2 tested the influence of role modeling on a group-level outcome (group discussions). Discussions following the role modeling show focused less on grievances, and included more positive lessons of the show, as well as more statements about collective efficacy and collective action. The findings highlight the influence of role modeling of collective action through media on efficacy and action for social change, but caution against unintended consequences on intergroup attitudes.}

In a vignette experiment female candidates are perceived as less suited to be squad leaders than their identical male counterparts. Adding positive information leads to higher evaluations of the candidates, but does not reduce the amount of discrimination. The boot camp provides an ideal setting for studying inter-group contact. We find that intense collaborative exposure to female colleagues reduces discriminatory attitudes: Male soldiers who were randomly assigned to share room and work in a squad with female soldiers during the recruit period do not discriminate in the vignette experiment.}

An experimental study was designed and tested to change negative attitudes towards the physically disabled. A pre-post-test intervention was conducted including three conditions: (a) cognitive intervention; (b) cognitive and behavioural intervention involving equal-status contact with the target group; (c) no-intervention control. The sample consisted of 70 ninth grade students. Following baseline assessments of attitudes, attitude change was measured immediately following the intervention and at a follow-up three months post-intervention. The cognitive intervention provided information about physical disability and challenged stereotypic conceptions about the physically disabled. The behavioural intervention consisted of engaging in three paralympic disciplines under the instruction of a group of disabled athletes. The cognitive intervention alone did not result in significant changes in attitudes towards the physically disabled. However, the combined cognitive-behavioural intervention resulted in greater attitude change than the no-intervention condition, both immediately post-intervention and at a three months follow-up. The findings are discussed with regard to models of attitude change through equal-status contact.}

Otherwise, access to positive legislative performance information actually lowered incumbent vote share. These results demonstrate the joint importance of salience and voter coordination in shaping information’s impact and breaking the clientelistic voting equilibrium.�}

We address this question by examining the effects of an intergroup contact intervention on ingroup dynamics that may mitigate intergroup conflict.

We present the results from a difference-in-differences design with 149 Jewish and Arab-Palestinian youth, some of whom participated in an intergroup contact and sports program operated by a nongovernmental organizations in Israel. Our main outcome is one’s tendency to censure ingroup members’ provocations toward the outgroup. As expected, we find a positive impact of the program on ingroup censuring. However, this result is only marginally significant. We find a positive effect of program participation on outgroup attitudes among Jewish youth as expected. To our surprise, among Arab-Palestinian youth, we find a negative effect on outgroup attitudes. Exploring the underlying processes and group-based differences further, we find that outgroup regard mediates the effect of intergroup contact on ingroup censuring for Jewish youth. We find no evidence for mediation among Arab-Palestinian youth but a positive association between ingroup censuring and psychological resources. These results suggest that the psychological conditions of ingroup censuring may differ by group. We discuss implications for peace-building interventions in societies with groups in conflict.}

Given the volume of resources committed every year to citizen-oriented programs that attempt to promote peace, this is an important question. We develop a framework to analyze processes through which individual-level interventions could mitigate violent conflict escalation more broadly. Individual-level interventions may increase positive feelings toward the outgroup, as well as psychological, social, and material resources among participants. These have the potential to influence behaviors such as policing of the ingroup, public advocacy, and political action that can contribute to peace. Yet, the effectiveness of interventions to influence the conflict is moderated by contextual factors like groups’ access to material resources, their positions in society, and political institutions. We use this analytical framework to assess evidence from recent intervention studies. We find that the current evidence base is quite small, does not cover the diversity of relevant contexts, and gives too little attention to resources and capacities that enable people to engage in conflict mitigation behaviors. Researchers and policy makers should go beyond thinking only about improving attitudes to thinking about behavior, resources, and capacities for such behaviors, and contextual conditions that constrain behavior.}

International peacebuilders took preventive action in Congo, but not as part of the protection efforts. Peacebuilders focused on preventing renewed national and regional wars, and they ignored the local conflicts that fuelled these broader tensions. The reason for this lies in a dominant culture of international peacebuilding. This culture shaped international efforts in such a way that the three essential conditions for effective prevention – political will, early warning and the preventive toolbox – were present for the prevention of renewed national and regional fighting but absent for the prevention of local violence. The resulting strategy allowed a crisis localized in the province of North Kivu to escalate into a full-scale war. The same type of effect appears generalizable across several recent interventions.}

The present research focuses on this latter process. What we term the group attribution error consists of the tendency to assume that group decisions reflect members’ attitudes. This assumption can be erroneous because group decision rules, in addition to members’ attitudes, can influence group decisions. In Experiment 1, members of a community in which a water conservation law was or was not instituted were assumed to have correspondent attitudes, regardless of how the community decision was made. In Experiments 2 and 3, subjects inferred a greater correspondence between out-group decisions and out-group attitudes than between an in-group decision and in-group attitudes. The fourth experiment found that subjects committed the group attribution error because they attended as much to the outcome of a recall election as to the actual proportion of voters for and against the recall. Finally, Experiment 5 showed that subjects’ inferences of jury members’ attitudes were influenced not only by the final jury vote but also by the actual decision, which was determined by the vote plus the decision rule by which the jury was bound. The results are related to previous research on the fundamental attribution error, stereotyping, and polarized appraisals of Out-groups.}

		Using data on every civil war fought between 1940 and 1992, Barbara Walter details the conditions that lead combatants to partake in what she defines as a three-step process--the decision on whether to initiate negotiations, to compromise, and, finally, to implement any resulting terms. Her key finding: rarely are such conflicts resolved without active third-party intervention.

		Walter argues that for negotiations to succeed it is not enough for the opposing sides to resolve the underlying issues behind a civil war. Instead the combatants must clear the much higher hurdle of designing credible guarantees on the terms of agreement--something that is difficult without outside assistance. Examining conflicts from Greece to Laos, China to Columbia, Bosnia to Rwanda, Walter confirms just how crucial the prospect of third-party security guarantees and effective power-sharing pacts can be--and that adversaries do, in fact, consider such factors in deciding whether to negotiate or fight. While taking many other variables into account and acknowledging that third parties must also weigh the costs and benefits of involvement in civil war resolution, this study reveals not only how peace is possible, but probable.

		Michael Doyle and Nicholas Sambanis argue that each mission must be designed to fit the conflict, with the right authority and adequate resources. UN missions can be effective by supporting new actors committed to the peace, building governing institutions, and monitoring and policing implementation of peace settlements.

		But the UN is not good at intervening in ongoing wars. If the conflict is controlled by spoilers or if the parties are not ready to make peace, the UN cannot play an effective enforcement role. It can, however, offer its technical expertise in multidimensional peacekeeping operations that follow enforcement missions undertaken by states or regional organizations such as NATO.

		Finding that UN missions are most effective in the first few years after the end of war, and that economic development is the best way to decrease the risk of new fighting in the long run, the authors also argue that the UN's role in launching development projects after civil war should be expanded.

		Previous statistical studies of the effects of UN peacekeeping have generally suggested that UN interventions have a positive effect on building a sustainable peace after civil war. Recent methodological developments have questioned this result because the cases in which the United Nations intervened were quite different from those in which they did not. Therefore the estimated causal effect may be due to the assumptions of the model that the researchers chose rather than to peacekeeping itself. The root of the problem is that UN missions are not randomly assigned.

		We argue that standard approaches for dealing with this problem (Heckman regression and instrumental variables) are invalid and impracticable in the context of UN peacekeeping and would lead to estimates of the effects of UN operations that are largely a result of the assumptions of the statistical model rather than the data.

		We correct for the effects of nonrandom assignment with matching techniques on a sample of UN interventions in post-Cold-War conflicts and find that UN interventions are indeed effective in the sample of post-civil-conflict interventions, but that UN interventions while civil wars are still ongoing have no causal effect

The data incorporate 150 conflicts during the period from 1945 to 1999, 101 of which had outside interventions. Using a hazard analysis, the results suggest that thirdparty interventions tend to extend expected durations rather than shorten them. The only aspect of the strategy for intervening that reduces the likelihood that a conflict will end in the next month is that it be biased in favor of either the opposition or the government. In effect, neutral interventions are less effective than biased ones.}

		Practitioners and scholars have long championed the positive effects of mediation by regional organizations on conflict resolution—an influence much quantitative research fails to confirm. Mediation by regional organizations signals powerful selection effects that can lead to erroneous inferences about the factors observed to influence the duration of dispute peace agreements. In order to control for selection, I develop a theory that accounts for the nature of the conflict and the identity of third-party mediators.

		Theoretically and statistically controlling for the negative effects of selection on agreement durability evinced through mediation by regional organizations makes clear their positive process effects. That is, by taking into account that regional mediators get especially hardto-manage disputes we can observe the positive ways that regional mediation contributes to dispute resolution. This study advances our understanding of conflict management, regional organizations, and civil war.

		Mediation has competing short- and long-term effects. In the short run, the actors are better able to identify and settle on a mutually satisfying outcome. In the long run, mediation can create artificial incentives that, as the mediator’s influence wanes and the combatants’ demands change, leave the actors with an agreement less durable than one that would have been achieved without mediation. This article tests the observable implications from this logic using a set of international crises from 1918 to 2001. The results reconcile findings in the previous literature that inconsistently portray the effectiveness of mediation.

		Stedman analyzes four international attempts to mediate a settlement to the Zimbabwean civil war of the 1970s and compares the three failed negotiations—the 1974-1975 Kenneth Kaunda/John Vorster "detente" exercise, the Henry Kissinger mediation that led to the Geneva conference of 1976, and the Anglo-American initiatives of David Owen and Cyrus Vance in 1977-1978—with the successful 1979 Lancaster House Conference on Rhodesia, chaired by Lord Carrington. Drawing on primary sources not available previously, his discussion of the factors that distinguish the failures from the successful attempt is a major contribution to conflict resolution theory, particularly with reference to the work of William Zartman. A final chapter considers the lessons of the Zimbabwe experience for South Africa today.

		No sooner had the Security Council voted to reduce UNAMIR's presence than it and Boutros-Ghali revisited whether and how the UN might respond to confront the increasingly evident genocide. Boutros-Ghali now began to take a visible lead, using his bully pulpit to formulate options and to urge the Security Council and the member states to respond vigorously to the continuing massa- cres.

		The Security Council, highly embarrassed that its only answer to the bloodshed was a reduction of UNAMIR, began to debate the possibility of an in- tervention force. But there were no volunteers for such a force. It seemed that the daily reports of carnage and brutality only contributed to the belief that it was highly improbable that a modest-sized outside force could halt the terror, and no member state was enthusiastic about sending its troops into such chaos. When the Secretariat finally unveiled its long-awaited plan in late April, it was greeted with considerable enthusiasm by the Security Council, although more because it created an image of a UN that was poised for action than because the plan was likely to contribute to ending the genocide.

		Simply put, this pro- posal was merely symbolic and highly impractical: it proposed to dispatch 5,000 troops to Kigali, ackriowledged that these troops might not be located for months (if ever), and confessed that it had no real idea what they would do once they arriv

		Mediation is one of the most widespread techniques for preventing conflict and promoting cooperation. I examine the conditions under which mediators can facilitate cooperation by building trust between two parties. Assuming mediators have no intrinsic commitment to honesty, they can be credible trust builders in one-round interactions only if they care about the issue at stake, have a moderate ideal point, and do not find conflict to be too costly. A mediator that is solely interested in promoting cooperation, or one that is biased toward one side, will be ineffective. A desire to preserve a reputation for honesty can overcome a limited amount of bias or issue indifference.

		Five factors are shown to be strongly related to civil war duration. Civil wars emerging from coups or revolutions tend to be short. Civil wars in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have also tended to be relatively brief, as have anti-colonial wars. By contrast, ‘sons of the soil’ wars that typically involve land conflict between a peripheral ethnic minority and state-supported migrants of a dominant ethnic group are on average quite long-lived. So are conflicts in which a rebel group derives major funding from contraband such as opium, diamonds, or coca. The article seeks to explain these regularities, developing a game model focused on the puzzle of what prevents negotiated settlements to longrunning, destructive civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an implausible explanation.

		*In the model, regional autonomy deals may be unreachable when fluctuations in state strength undermine the government’s ability to commit.* The commitment problem binds harder when the center has an enduring political or economic interest in expansion into the periphery, as in ‘sons of the soil’ wars, and when either government or rebels are able to earn some income during a conflict despite the costs of fighting, as in the case of contraband funding.

		Definition A reputation is a judgment of someone’s character or disposition that is then used to predict or explain future behavior. Note that a reputation is dispositional and not situational.

		Reputation and Rational Deterrence Theory The central problem in deterrence theory is making threats and promises credible. Credibility rests on resolve, capability and interests. Mercer argues that capability and interests are situational attributions, and therefore he focuses only on resolve, as a way to define a reputation.

		Three false assumptions of Rational Deterrence Theory (1) observed behavior is self-evident (everyone must know how the target behaved and must draw the same inference form that behavior, inferring weakness from weak behavior and strength from strong behavior). (2) reputation is a property concept and not a relational concept (since how to interpret a certain behavior is common knowledge, one can strategically manipulate the perceptions of others and therefore reputation). (3) commitments are interdependent (it is assumed that past behavior is always used to predict future behavior and that future situations are similar to previous ones). -Mercer contends that these assumptions neglect the fact that reputation is a relational concept. People interpret a certain observation in many different ways. As for the first two assumptions, you cannot possibly assume that the others interpret a certain behavior in the same way you think they will. Therefore, one cannot manipulate or control a reputation As for the third assumption, international politics rarely resembles an iterated game because the same situation is not going to be repeated and because the actor’s type is not perfectly correlated across games. Also, whether people use the past to predict the future behavior should be a question to be examined not an assumption.

		Reputation and Social Psychology -Drawing on social psychology theories, Mercer argues that decision-makers tend to use situational attributions for desirable behavior, whereas they tend to use character-based attributions for undesirable behaviors. -The desirability of a state’s actions rather than expectations plays an important role in determining a how a country’s behavior will shape its reputation. There is a potential endogeneity problem in theories which say expectations shape reputation. -Therefore, we have the following hypotheses: situational explanations will be used to describe desirable behaviors (ally stands firm and adversary backs down), dispositional explanations will be used to describe undesirable behaviors (ally backs down and adversary stands firm). See table 3. -Finally, four propositions are noted: allies rarely gain reputations for resolve whereas adversaries rarely gain reputations for irresolution.

Characteristics of a conflict which affect its susceptibility to mediation include: (1) the distribu- tion of power among the protagonists, (2) the interests at stake, (3) the price of nonsettlement, and (4) personality factors.}

		International mediation of violent conflicts is commonplace in today’s world, and so is academic research on its features and effectiveness. But research that speaks to both the initiation and implementation of mediation remains relatively rare. This article outlines a theoretical and empirical argument that contributes to filling this gap and suggests a counterintuitive selection effect: potential mediators that are likely to resolve a dispute are unlikely to select into mediation. The argument hinges on the claim that **mediation by biased third parties is relatively ineffective**, and I provide qualitative evidence to suggest that this claim is plausible.

		"biased mediators are relatively less effective at resolving disputes than their unbiased counterparts, because only an unbiased mediator can credibly share conflict-relevant insights."

		"My argument that biased mediation is relatively ineffective reflects the relationship between mediation and the informational setting within which antagonists operate. While disputants face incentives to avoid costly conflicts, they sometimes fail to do so because they find themselves unable to agree on what the outcome of an armed struggle would be (Fearon, 1995)...each disputant possesses private information, for example about battle strength or resolve, but has incentives to exaggerate in order to extract an advantageous settlement."

		"In this situation an unbiased mediator can credibly convey private, conflictrelevant information that he or she holds, because the disputants know that the mediator does not care about how exactly the incompatibility between the disputants is resolved. This is not the case for a biased mediator..."

		We construct a theory of persistent civil conflicts, where persistence is driven by the endogenous dynamics of inter-ethnic trust and trade. In times of peace, agents belonging to two groups are randomly matched to trade bilaterally. Trade hinges on trust and cooperation. The onset of conflict signals that the aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate, harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history of conflicts and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars are persistent. Moreover, even accidental conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a society into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs. Coercive peace policies, such as peacekeeping forces or externally imposed regime changes, have no enduring effects.

		Civil war begets more civil war.  "Imperfect and, possibly, incorrect learning is the source of endogenous persistence."

		"First, policies increasing the profitability of inter-ethnic trade reduce the incidence of conflict. Examples include policies abating barriers, such as educational policies promoting the knowledge of several national languages, or subsidies for human-capital investments. Second, policies directly targeting people’s held beliefs may be useful."

		"On the contrary, attempts to impose peace through coercion—e.g. peacekeeping forces or externally imposed regime changes—ultimately have no persistent effects, especially if they fail to restore trade links. **Forcing the separation of groups may even be harmful, since such measures would stifle any potential for trade cooperation** that otherwise may emerge during peace spells, and that over time may slowly restore confidence."

FRIEDMAN did very well with RANDOM, and since it is nice, it did well with all the other nice rules. But it did not do well with the kingmakers, because it did not let them recover from the consequences of their first defection. This brings us to the important property of forgiveness of a decision rule."

		"Forgiveness of a rule is its propensity to cooperate in the moves after the other player has defected."

		"The moral is that if both sides are unforgiving in the way that JOSS and TIT FOR TAT were, it does not pay to be as greedy as JOSS was."

		"TIT FOR TAT won the tournament. This was the simplest rule submitted: Cooperate on the first move and then do whatever the other player did on the previous move. One implication is that reciprocity is not only a social norm, but can also be an extremely successful operating rule for an individualistic pragmatist"

		"A sophisticated analysis must go at least three levels deep. First is the direct effect of a choice. This is easy, since a defection always earns more than a cooperation. Second are the indirect effects, taking into account that the other side may or may not punish a defection. This much was certainly appreciated by many of the entrants. But third is the fact that in responding to the defections of the other side, one may be repeating or even amplifying one's own previous exploitative choice. Thus a single occasional defection may be successful when analyzed for its direct effects, and perhaps even when its secondary effects are taken into account. But the real costs may be in the tertiary effects when one's own isolated defections turn into unending mutual recriminations"

		"The sample program sent to prospective contestants to show them how to make a submission would in fact have won the tournament if anyone had simply clipped it and mailed it in! But no one did. This rule is to defect only if the other player defected on the previous two moves. It is a more forgiving version of TIT FOR TAT in that it does not punish isolated defections. The excellent performance of the TIT FOR TWO TATS rule highlights the fact that a common error of the contestants was to expect that gains could be made from being relatively less forgiving than TIT FOR TAT, whereas in fact there were big gains to be made from being even more forgiving. The implication of this finding is striking, since it suggests that expert strategists do not give sufficient weight to the importance of forgiveness"

		Persuasion "Learning from others requires persuasion. We define persuasion as one person's successful attempt to change the beliefs of another. In settings where reasoned choice requires learning from others, persuasion is a necessary condition for reasoned choice" (p 40).

		Speakers are persuasive if principals perceive them as knowledgable and having congruent interests. The term "perceive" is crucial. Details:

		Interests: You must perceive that the speaker has interests in common with you (you often learn this through time and experience--does the Sierra Club consistently take positions you agree with?) Knowledge: You must perceive that the speaker actually has the knowledge you need. Both these conditions are reduced by external factors:

		Costly Signals: Whether the speaker can send you a costly signal (e.g. by putting his reputation on the line; as an example, Bush claimed he would fire any aides found to have leaked classified information--a costly reputational signal.)

		Penalties for Lying. Lying under oath results in prison time--a costly penalty for lying, if caught. Penalties might also be political--if we found out that a particular speaker's statement were false, would the resulting fallout end that speaker's career?

		Likelihood of Verification of the speaker's words by some other party. Is there anybody out there doing reliable fact checking? You can also learn from a speaker with interests opposite to your own if you witness that speaker addressing people with common interests. For example, a Democratic can watch Rush Limbaugh address Republicans and pick up important information.

		Using the Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma–Maximizing Differences Game to model intergroup conflict, the experiment reported here shows that compared to individuals with a chronic pro-self orientation, those with a chronic pro-social orientation display stronger ingroup trust and ingroup love—they self-sacrifice to benefit their ingroup—but not more or less outgroup distrust and outgroup hate. Furthermore, in this situation pro-social individuals were driven more by ingroup fairness considerations when contributing to their ingroup. Path analyses suggest that effects of social value orientation on ingroup love are mediated by ingroup trust and not by fairness considerations.

		What motivates individual self-sacrificial behavior in intergroup conflicts? Is it the altruistic desire to help the in-group or the aggressive drive to hurt the outgroup? This article introduces a new game paradigm, the intergroup prisoner’s dilemma–maximizing difference (IPD-MD) game, designed specifically to distinguish between these two motives. The game involves two groups. Each group member is given a monetary endowment and can decide how much of it to contribute. Contribution can be made to either of two pools, one that benefits the ingroup at a personal cost and another that, in addition, harms the out-group.

		An experiment demonstrated that contributions in the IPD-MD game are made almost exclusively to the cooperative, within-group pool.

		Moreover, preplay intragroup communication increases intragroup cooperation, but not intergroup competition. These results are compared with those observed in the intergroup prisoner’s dilemma game, in which group members’ contributions are restricted to the competitive, between-group pool."

		We experimentally examine intergroup conflict between natural groups. • We compare behavior of groups with no/weak/strong enmity. • Outgroup hate could be expressed by harm or by help avoidance. • Enmity matters only for help avoidance, **except when conflict is morality-based.** • The stronger the enmity, the more people chose to avoid helping the outgroup.

		"Another characteristic of natural groups,which is absent fromartificial groups, is the degree towhich they are morality-based.Members of morality-based groups share convictions about standards and principles on the distinction between right and wrong, as opposed to attitudes on matters of taste and preference (good or bad). Importantly, the degree to which shared moral convictions form the basis of a morality-based group depends on the existence of a salient outgroup holding opposing moral convictions (Haidt, 2001). For example, attitudes regarding the legality of abortion in the United States define distinct morality-based groups (pro-choice vs. pro-life) on the national level,where the respective outgroups are highly salient, but not in the context of, e.g., post graduate democrats, where pro-choice is nearly consensual.5 At the interpersonal level, disagreements onmatters ofmorality are accompanied by strong emotions, intolerance, a desire for social/ physical distance, lack of goodwill, and little regard for procedural safeguards (Parker & Janoff-Bulman, 2013). Relying on these results, Parker and Janoff-Bulman conjecture that this pattern should be relevant to intergroup relations aswell, such that outgroup negativitywill play a central role when groups are morality-based. They show that members of morality-based groups display more negative emotions towards (morally distinct) outgroups than members of non-morality-based groups."

		Based on the unique features of morality, we suggest that

		**group memberships rooted in moral convictions are a special classification of inherently threatening social groups in which outgroup “hate” naturally occurs with ingroup “love.”**

		Three studies explored emotional reactions to ingroups and outgroups by individuals whose group memberships were either morality-based or non-morality-based.

		**Results of each study indicated that individuals in morality-based groups reported less positive ingroup emotions and more negative outgroup emotions and threat than did those in non-morality-based groups.**

		Additionally, strength of morality-based identification was predicted by attitudes about both the ingroup and the outgroup, but only attitudes about the ingroup predicted identification for non-morality-based groups. Together, these studies suggest a necessary interdependence of ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity for social groups based in morality. We conclude that negative outgroup-related emotions may be just as important as positive ingroup-related emotions for social identification based on moral convictions.

In this article, the first section presents the theoretical background of infra-humanization and distinguishes it from related concepts, such as dehumanization. The three basic hypotheses of the theory are then presented with a summary of empirical evidence. Social implications follow. Reasons for the pervasiveness of the phenomenon are examined as well as conditions that lead a specific outgroup to be infrahumanized. We also explore the consequences of infra-humanization, such as a lack of forgiveness for the outgroup and the ingroup’s justification for past misdeeds against the outgroup, rather than guilt. Policy issues center on ways to combat essentialism, walls of difference between groups, and irrational symbols of superiority. The roles of egalitarian values and of deprovincialized intergroup contact are emphasized."

		“infra-humanization,” or “subhumanization,” but from an etymological point of view it means something very different. We were interested to show that people are inclined to perceive members of outgroups as somewhat less human, or more animal-like, than themselves; such a view corresponds to the word infrahumanization (although we could also have used “subhumanization”). By contrast, dehumanization of an outgroup implies that its members are no longer humans at all. It is this complete deprivation of humanity that explains why dehumanization is often used in extreme cases such as in armed conflicts, when others are no longer humans, but vicious animals or dispensable objects (Bar-Tal, 1989; Staub, 1989). When there is dehumanization, there is “moral exclusion” (Opotow, 1990) in the sense that people are no longer protected by values such as morality; they may suffer anything from actors who do not have moral restraints. Our aim, however, was to show that something of much lesser magnitude could occur in everyday life.

		Perception–action-coupling refers to the vicarious activation of the neural system for action during perception of action, and is considered important for forms of interpersonal sensitivity, including empathy. We hypothesize that perception–action-coupling is limited to the ingroup: neural motor networks will fire upon the perception of action, but only when the object–person belongs to the ingroup;

		**if the object–person belongs to an outgroup these motor neurons will not fire.**

		Using electroencephalographic oscillations as an index of perception–action-coupling, we found exactly this: participants displayed activity over motor cortex when acting and when observing ingroups act, but not when observing outgroups – an effect magnified by prejudice and for disliked groups (South-Asians, then Blacks, followed by East Asians). These findings provide evidence from brain activity for yet another detrimental aspect of prejudice: a spontaneous and implicit simulation of others’ action states may be limited to close others and, without active effort, may not be available for outgroups.

The purported ‘‘development” objective of land privatization is to stimulate agricultural productivity based on the assumption that land titling will lead farmers and herders to make greater investments in their production systems. This paper argues that the mobile livestock raising system of immigrant FulBe pastoralists in Côte d’Ivoire is threatened by the new land law. Since mobility is crucial to animal health and fertility rates, I argue that reduced mobility will lead to lower livestock productivity. Although the land law has yet to be implemented, its very existence is leading prospective claimants to test their land rights by planting orchards and lending land to immigrant farmers. The monetization of land lending and grazing rights is increasingly common. Land disputes over who has the power to allocate land are also on the rise. I argue that this heightened interest in ‘‘tenure building” is constraining herd mobility, especially for herders with limited resources to negotiate access to rangelands. On the other hand, land privatization is strengthening the hand of local cattle-owning farmers who increasingly practice mobile livestock raising and compete with FulBe herders for grazing lands. Under these new conditions of land access, control, and competition, FulBe herd mobility and productivity are at risk of declining.}

Typically, herders gain access to harvested crop fields to feed their animals on free range basis, while the animals dropping fertilize crop fields. This complementarity between herders and farmers, however, has broken due to the growth in population in Africa and the continuous allocation of land and labour between large cattle herders and crop producers (Cotula et al., 2004). This broken relationship has tended to increase resource conflicts among herders and croppers.}

Moreover, socio-economic change has in many places eroded the customary rules and institutions that have traditionally administered land rights.

As political and technological changes bring increased interstate immigration, understanding intergroup contact and demographic change is increasingly important to policy and scientic debates. Unfortunately, limitations in causal inference with observational data and the practical inability to experiment on demographic context have constrained scholars' ability to speak to the eects of intergroup contact. Here I report the results of an experiment testing the causal eects of prolonged intergroup contact in which Spanish-speaking confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted, for an extended period, into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus simulating the conditions of demographic change. The result of this controlled experiment is a signicant shift toward exclusionary attitudes among treated subjects. However there is evidence that the initial aversion diminishes over time. This experiment demonstrates that even very minor demographic change causes strong exclusionary reactions.}

Sixty-two fourteen to Byteen years’ old school-boys andgirls were randomly assigned to a high or low reward condition in which they distributed monetary rewards, via choice-matrices, to the ingroup and a relevant comparison outgroup, and the ingroup and an irrelevant comparison outgroup.

		Monetary self-interest was explicitly and directly linked to ingroup’s absolute profit.

In the first study, Jewish people assigned more internal responsibility to Germans for their treatment of Jewish people during the Second World War than Germans assigned to their own group. In the second study, people attributed the negative historical actions of another nation more internally (and less externally) than similar negative historical actions committed by their own nation.

		This pattern of intergroup attributional bias was more pronounced among people who highly identified with their national ingroup. Outgroup homogeneity and perceptions of differences between the groups were also significantly predicted by ingroup identification.

		In particular, many people have no idea about the basic laws of probability. For example, Herb Gintis once offered a plausible alternative explanation for why the mean offer in the Henrich (2000) UG run with the Machegeunga in Peru was so low. The published reason has to do with culture and the low frequency of interacting with strangers.

		While this reasoning fits well with the other observations from the 15 small scale societies project, a plausible alternative is that nothing is random to people living in Amazonia. Henrich flipped a coin to see if each participant was going to be the first-mover or the second-mover. A coin flip does not mean the same thing to a person who believes that supernatural forces determine the course of events. Such a person may think that she was chosen to be the first-mover for a reason, and with that mindset demanding most of the pie does not seem unreasonable.

	abstract     = {Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has rejuvenated the social sciences, dramatically reducing the cost and inconvenience of collecting original data. Recently, however, researchers have raised concerns about the presence of “non-respondents” (bots) and non-serious respondents on the platform. Spurred by these concerns, we fielded an original survey on MTurk to measure response quality. While we find no evidence of a “bot epidemic,” we do find that a significant portion of survey respondents behaved suspiciously while taking the survey. About 20% of respondents either circumvented location requirements or took the survey multiple times, and at least 5-7% of participants likely engaged in “trolling” or satisficing. Altogether, we find about a quarter of data collected on MTurk is potentially untrustworthy. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that the prevalence of low quality responses in MTurk data has increased over time, and that low quality responses are more common on MTurk than on other online survey platforms. Finally, we find response quality impacts experimental treatments. On average, low quality responses attenuate treatment effects by approximately 10%. We conclude by providing recommendations for collecting data on MTurk.}

		Explanations of error in survey self-reports have focused on social desirability: that respondents answer questions about normative behavior to appear prosocial to interviewers.

		However, this paradigm fails to explain why bias occurs even in self-administered modes like mail and web surveys. We offer an alternative explanation rooted in identity theory that focuses on measurement directiveness as a cause of bias.

		After completing questions about physical exercise on a web survey, respondents completed a text message–based reporting procedure, sending updates on their major activities for five days. Random assignment was then made to one of two conditions: instructions mentioned the focus of the study, physical exercise, or not. Survey responses, text updates, and records from recreation facilities were compared. Direct measures generated bias—overreporting in survey measures and reactivity in the directive text condition—but the nondirective text condition generated unbiased measures. Findings are discussed in terms of identity

Next, they (b) need to retrieve relevant information from memory. In most cases, a previously formed judgment that meets the specifics of the question will not be accessible and they have to draw on information that seems relevant to the question at hand. Relevant information includes features of the attitude object, the respondent's apparent affective response to the object, as well as information about the respondent's own behavior with regard to the object. Based on this information, respondents (c) need to compute a judgment. Having formed a judgment, they (d) can rarely report it in their own words but need to map it onto a set of response alternatives provided by the researcher. Finally, (e) respondents may want to edit their private judgment before they communicate it to the researcher for reasons of social desirability and self-presentation. Performance at each of these steps is context dependent, yet this context dependency has differential implications for the notion that people hold enduring attitudes.}

In many of the experiments, some participants are provided with a conscious goal. Other participants are given a task that primes the same goals, either a memory goal or an impression goal, but does so without the participant's awareness. Unaware participants appear to make the same goal-relevant response as do participants who are aware of the goal.

In such an approach this soap opera should not only fit into the cultural and social contexts of its child audience but should actively promote discussion and the interactive negotiation of meaning. The narratives address post conflict concerns of democracy, rights, peace and reconciliation, encouraging dialogue with peers and family about extremely difficult issues.

In so doing, MKBKSH not only garnered a staggering audience of 400 million, it pioneered the use of an interactive voice response (IVR) system to invite feedback from diverse audience members and to track their engagement with the programme in real time. Our analysis documents 1.7 million calls from over 390,000 unique phone numbers. Given the high penetration of mobile telephony in India, and its uniquely invitational nature, the IVR system enabled women, youth and the less privileged, to access curated content, answer questions and share personal opinions and actions inspired by MKBKSH. The IVR’s simple user interface and purposive use – akin to the ‘voicebook’ of the have-nots – hold important implications for the design, implementation and evaluation of large-scale, realtime communication and social change interventions.}

Under the overarching framework of entertainment-education, we utilised protection motivation theory to carry out a systematic three-part mixed-methods evaluation of DRTS. Study 1 was a qualitative content analysis of how domestic violence was portrayed in all 23 episodes of DRTS, identifying themes and scenes that could influence viewers’ threat and coping appraisal of domestic violence.  In Study 2, a quantitative content analysis of 1,848 viewer posts spread over an eight-year period was carried out on DRTS’ online forum, ascertaining how they reflected the viewers’ threat and coping appraisal about domestic violence. Study 3 was an on-line survey with Chinese nationals (N=326) that tested how their threat and coping appraisal with respect to domestic violence influenced the relationships between program exposure and three behavioural intention outcomes—i.e., victim coping, bystander intervention, and policy support. Our triangulated results suggested that, overall, DRTS was highly effective in using fear appeals to get the public’s attention on domestic violence, spur public discussions on the topic, and foster a favorable policy climate—one that culminated in 2015 in the passage of anti-domestic violence legislation.}

The participatory experiments were carried out by 101 rice farmers. Although farmers' perceptions of pests and pesticide use were deeply entrenched, the simple experiment reduced their early-season insecticide applications and number of sprays. Farmers attitudes toward leaf-feeding insects also changed. Besides dissonance resolution, the main incentives that had encouraged farmers seemed to be money savings and labor reduction. Few studies in communication, if any, have explored the impact of the use of conflict information on changing farmers' perceptions.

White males are signicantly aected by both the number (quantity) and aptitude (quality) of the black peers with whom they are exposed. Specically, white men randomly assigned to higher-aptitude black peers report being more accepting of blacks in general and are more likely to match with a black roommate the following year after reassignment to a new peer group with a dierent set of black peers.

		In a modified 4X4 factorial design with race (black-white) of the harm-doer and race (black-white) of the victim as the major factors, the phenomenon of differential social perception of intergroup violence was established.

		White subjects, observing a videotape of purported ongoing interaction occuring in another room, labeled an act (ambiguous shove) as more violent when it was performed by a black than when the same act was perpetrated by a white. That is, the concept of violence was more accessible when viewing a black than when viewing a white committing the same act.

		Causal attributions were also found to be divergent. Situation attributions were preferred when the harm-doer was white, and person (dispositional) attributions were preferred in the black-protagonist conditions. The results are discussed in terms of perceptual threshold, stereotypy, and attributional biases.

		Despite its early origins and adaptive functions, empathy is not inevitable; people routinely fail to empathize with others, especially members of different social or cultural groups. In five experiments, we systematically explore how social identity, functional relations between groups, competitive threat, and perceived entitativity contribute to intergroup empathy bias:

		the tendency not only to empathize less with out-group relative to in-group members, but also to feel pleasure in response to their pain (and pain in response to their pleasure).

		When teams are set in direct competition, affective responses to competition-irrelevant events are characterized not only by less empathy toward out-group relative to in-groupmembers, but also by increased counter-empathic responses: Schadenfreude and Glückschmerz (Experiment 1). Comparing responses to in-group and out-group targets against responses to unaffiliated targets in this competitive context suggests that intergroup empathy bias may be better characterized by out-group antipathy rather than extraordinary in-group empathy (Experiment 2). We also find that intergroup empathy bias is robust to changes in relative group standing—feedback indicating that the out-group has fallen behind (Experiment 3a) or is no longer a competitive threat (Experiment 3b) does not reduce the bias. However, reducing perceived in-group and out-group entitativity can significantly attenuate intergroup empathy bias (Experiment 4). This research establishes the boundary conditions of intergroup empathy bias and provides initial support for a more integrative framework of group-based empathy

Social bases of influence, cognitive processes involved, motivations for being influenced, effects of minority and majority influence attempts, and the magnitude of influence are discussed. We then examine indirect evidence for the relevance of social categorization to influence in groups before going on to present an analysis in terms of social identity and self-categorization theories. Direct tests of the theory in the areas of conformity, group polarization and norm formation are described and the discussion then broadens to include other issues which are raised by alternative formulations. In particular we address the questions of compliance versus true conformity (or agreement), public and private behaviour, majority and minority influence, and magnitude versus quality of influence. We conclude by suggesting some directions for future research.}

In Study 1, we tested the interaction between contact quantity and valence on prejudice toward Black Australians (n = 1,476), Muslim Australians (n = 173), and asylum seekers (n = 293). In all cases, the association between contact quantity and prejudice was moderated by its valence, with negative contact emerging as a stronger and more consistent predictor than positive contact. In Study 2, White Americans (n = 441) indicated how much positive and negative contact they had with Black Americans on separate measures. Although both quantity of positive and negative contact predicted racism and avoidance, negative contact was the stronger predictor. Furthermore, negative (but not positive) contact independently predicted suspicion about Barack Obama’s birthplace. These results extend the contact hypothesis by issuing an important caveat: Negative contact may be more strongly associated with increased racism and discrimination than positive contact is with its reduction.}

		The barriers of special concern in this chapter,’ as our opening quote from the late Egyptian leader suggests, are psychological. We explore cognitive and motivational processes that impede mutually beneficial exchanges of concessions and render seemingly tractable conflicts refractory to negotiated resolution. In such cases, we argue, the failure to achieve significant progress represents a kind of “market inefficiency,” in much the same sense that there is a failure or inefficiency when a motivated buyer and seller are unable to consummate a deal under conditions where the buyer’s maximum purchase price exceeds the seller’s minimum selling price.

		We shall begin by distinguishing psychological barriers from two other kinds of impediments-those that are essentially products of strategic calculation and those that arise from “impersonal” organizational, institutional, or structural factors having little to do either with calculation or with the psychological biases exhibited by individual actors. We shall then proceed to a more detailed examination of five particular psychological barriers that have figured heavily in our own research and that of our fellow investigators at the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation (SCCN). Next, we shall examine three broader theoretical perspectives that speak to sources of resentment, misunderstanding, misattribution, and distrust in the negotiation process-once again with disproportionate, but not exclusive, emphasis on our own work and that of our SCCN colleagues (see Arrow, Mnookin, Ross, Tversky, & Wilson, in press). Finally, we shall explore some tentative implications for the theory and practice of dispute resolution, especially for those intrepid third-party facilitators, mediators, or peacemakers who confront what is surely one of the most important and difficult challenges in the whole broad spectrum of applied social psychology.

	abstract     = {Expectancies play an important and understudied role in influencing a negotiator's decision to be deceptive. Studies 1a–1e investigated the sources of negotiators' expectancies, finding evidence of projection and pessimism; negotiators consistently overestimated the prevalence of people who share their views on deception and assumed a sizable share of others embrace deceptive tactics. This phenomenon generalized beyond American samples to Chinese students (Study 1d) and Turkish adults (Study 1e). Study 2 demonstrated that pessimistic expectancies about others' ethics positively predicted the degree to which negotiators were dishonest, above and beyond their own stated ethical views, and that it did so across both distributive and integrative negotiations. Study 3 provided evidence of a causal relationship between expectancies of others' ethical views and dishonest behavior by manipulating expectancies. Study 4 provided additional evidence of this causal relationship in a live, dyadic exchange where performance was incentive compatible. Negotiators' deceptive behavior was shaped by their pessimism about others' ethical standards. We consider the implications of these findings for preventing deception in negotiations.}

People who are high in trait collective self-esteem should be more likely to react to threats to collective self-esteem by derogating outgroups and enhancing the ingroup. In a study using the minimal intergroup paradigm, trait personal and collective self-esteem were measured, and subjects received information about the average performance of their group. Subjects high in collective self-esteem varied their ratings of above-average and below-average scorers on the test in an ingroup-enhancing fashion, whereas those low in collective self-esteem did not. Analyses based on personal self-esteem did not show this interaction. We conclude that collective self-esteem is an individual difference variable that may moderate the attempt to maintain a positive social identity. The relation between collective and personal self-esteem is discussed.}

The results are consistent with both social identity theory and much previous research in this area: The greater the in-group identification, the greater the allocation of social value in favor of the in-group. The results are also consistent with the expectations of social dominance theory and show that, even after the effects of gender, self-esteem, and in-group identification were considered, the greater the social dominance orientation, the greater the allocation of social value in favor of the in-group. For two of the three indexes of social value, there was a statistically significant interaction between in-group identification and social dominance orientation. Subjects showing strong acceptance of their in-group classification and who had relatively high levels of social dominance orientation displayed greater in-group bias.}

Typically, a competitive process tends to produce the following effects: 1. Communication between the conflicting parties is unreliable and impoverished. 2. It stimulates the view that the solution of the conflict can only be imposed by one side or the other by means of superior force, deception, or cleverness. 3. It leads to a suspicious, hostile attitude that increases the sensitivity to differences and threats while minimizing the awareness of similarities.

		Misjudgment and misperception. In our preceding discussion of the effects of competition, it was evident that impoverished communication, hostile attitudes, and oversensitivity to differences could lead to distorted views of the other that could intensify and perpetuate conflict... Many of these misperceptions function to transform a conflict, even if the conflict did not emerge from a competitive relationship."

In contrast to the reigning idea that these effects are mediated by the automatic formation and activation of associations in memory, we describe an inferential account that specifies the inferences underlying the effects and how these inferences are formed. We draw on predictive processing theories to explain the basic processes underlying inferential reasoning and their main characteristics. Our inferential account accommodates past findings, is supported by new findings, and leads to novel predictions as well as concrete recommendations for how action performance can be used to influence real-world behavior.}

Although sample sizes are too small to provide definitive evidence, these results suggest students become more empathetic with the social groups to which their roommates belong.}

Second, net of pre-existing attitudes, we examined the effects of voluntary roommate contact during the second and third year of university on fourth year prejudice. Consistent with contact theory, both randomly assigned and voluntary contact decreased prejudice. Also, there was generalization to other outgroups, particularly from Black roommates to Latinos, and vice versa. Finally, an interesting exception was found for contact with Asian American roommates, whether randomly assigned or voluntary, which tended to make attitudes towards other groups more negative. Potential explanations for this result are discussed.}

First, it defines and characterizes the nature of intractable conflict, and then it describes how societies involved in this reality adapt to the conditions of intractable conflict. This adaptation meets three fundamental challenges: satisfying the needs of the society members, coping with stress, and withstanding the rival. In trying to confront them successfully, societies develop appropriate sociopsychological infrastructure, which includes collective memory, ethos of conflict, and collective emotional orientations. This infrastructure fulfills important individual and collective level functions, including the important role of formation, maintenance, and strengthening of a social identity that reflects this conflict. Special attempts are made to disseminate this infrastructure via societal channels of communication and institutionalize it. The evolved sociopsychological infrastructure becomes a prism through which society members construe their reality, collect new information, interpret their experiences, and make decisions about their course of action. This infrastructure becomes hegemonic, rigid, and resistant to change as long as the intractable conflict continues. It ends up serving as a major factor fueling the continuation of the conflict, thus becoming part of a vicious cycle of intractable conflict.}

		This paper reviews the research on cooperative learning methods, with an emphasis on understanding the complex changes that occur in both classroom organization and student friendship patterns when cooperative, integrated learning groups are used in the desegregated classroom. Cooperative learning methods explicitly use the strength of the desegregated school and the presence of students of different races or ethnicities, to enhance intergroup relations and other outcomes.

		Results of studies relating cooperative learning to intergroup relations clearly indicate that when students work in ethnically mixed cooperative-learning groups, they gain in cross-ethnic friendships. This research indicates that the effects of cooperative learning on intergroup relations are strong and lasting. Practical implications of these findings are unambiguously supportive of implementing contact theory in the desegregated classroom.

		On the difficulty of social learning for specific lessons: "In dealing with naturally occurring events it is exceedingly difficult to estbalish precisely the stimulus sources of a person's social behavior."  It's hard to know what stimulus prompted a person's behavior.

		On similarity between observer and model: "Modeling can be significantly influenced by real or assumed similarity between the observer and the model."  Page 244 / 32.

		But people socially learn from models whose behavior produces good outcomes! Page 247 / 35.

Specifically, we propose that the motivation to cooperate is generated by the reward system in the brain (extending from striatum to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex), and that it can be modulated by two neural networks: a cognitive control system (centered on the lateral prefrontal cortex) that processes extrinsic cooperative incentives, and/or a social cognition system (including the superior temporal sulcus, the anterior medial frontal cortex and the amygdala) that processes trust signals. The independent modulatory influence of incentives and trust on the decision to cooperate is substantiated by a growing body of neuroimaging data and reconciles the apparent paradox between economic versus social rationality in the literature, suggesting that we are in fact wired for both. Furthermore, the theoretical framework can account for substantial behavioral heterogeneity in prosocial behavior. Based on the existing data, we further postulate that self-regarding individuals (who are more likely to adopt an economically rational strategy) are more responsive to extrinsic cooperative incentives and therefore rely relatively more on cognitive control to make (un)cooperative decisions, whereas other-regarding individuals (who are more likely to adopt a socially rational strategy) are more sensitive to trust signals to avoid betrayal and recruit relatively more brain activity in the social cognition system.},

		Authoritarianism, comprising conventionalism, authoritarian submission, and authoritarian aggression, is an important factor underlying prejudice and social discrimination and therefore is typically perceived as socially problematic. In contrast, our work examines adaptive features of authoritarianism. Evolutionary game theoretical considerations (e.g., biased social learning) point to authoritarian psychological processes that establish and foster group life (e.g., high levels of ingroup cooperation).

		First, the evolution of social learning (particularly conformist and prestige biases) leads to the establishment of local and distinct cultural groups (conventionalism). Second, local cultural rules solve coordination dilemmas by transforming these rules into normative standards against which others are evaluated (authoritarian submission). Third, the common rules within a particular culture or group are reinforced by a tendency to reward norm compliance and punish norm deviations (authoritarian aggression).

		Implications regarding the deduction of novel research questions as well as dealing with authoritarianism as a social problem are discussed.

Explanations of the underlying motivation to participate in an intergroup conflict, however, remain unsatisfactory. While previous research shows that intergroup conflict increases ‘in-group love’, it fails to identify robust triggers of ‘out-group hate’. Here, we present a controlled laboratory experiment, which demonstrates that ‘out-group hate’ can be provoked systematically. We find direct and causal evidence that the intention to protect the in-group is not only a crucial motivator of ‘out-group hate’ in defensive reactions, but also promotes preemptive offensive actions against out-group threat. Hence, the strength of ‘out-group hate’ depends on whether the own group is perceived to be on the offensive or the defensive side of the conflict. This finding improves our understanding of the escalation of intergroup conflicts and may have important implications for their prevention, as we find in our experiment that removing out-group threat substantially reduces intergroup aggression, leading to full peace.}

This chapter reviews our own work, and that of others, showing that parochial cooperation (1) emerges especially when it benefits individuals’ within-group reputation, (2) affects one’s withingroup status, (3) is more prominent among individuals with chronic prosocial rather than proself value orientation, and (4) is sustained and motivated by oxytocin, an evolutionary ancient hypothalamic neuropeptide pivotal in social bonding, pair–bond formation, and empathic responding. Across the board, findings resonate well with relatively recent evolutionary theory on (inter)group relations and add to classic theory in social psychology.}

		two well-studied determinants of cooperative behavior: incentives and social information.

		Much experimental evidence in both laboratory and field settings indicates that cooperation increases when extrinsic incentives are incorporated into the decision-making context, such that the cooperative decision itself becomes rewarding (Bornstein, 2003).

		evolutionary psychologists have repeatedly shown that subtle social cues affect cooperation when they trigger heuristics or cognitive biases that have been shaped by natural selection to help people solve problems related to social exchange (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992; Haselton and Nettle, 2006). Such social cues are thought to be informative with regards to the profitability of cooperation in several ways, including kin relationships (Lieberman et al., 2007), possible reputation benefits (Haley and Fessler, 2005), or trust (Boone et al., 2008

The methods that have been proposed often incur costs that (more than) destroy the efficiency gains through increased cooperation. It has for example been shown that inter-group conflict increases intra-group cooperation, however at the cost of collective efficiency. We propose a new method that makes use of the positive effects associated with inter-group competition but avoids the detrimental (cost) effects of a structural conflict. We show that the mere comparison to another structurally independent group increases both the level of intra-group cooperation and overall efficiency. The advantage of this new method is that it directly transfers the benefits from increased cooperation into increased efficiency. In repeated public goods provision we experimentally manipulated the participants’ level of contribution feedback (intra-group only vs. both intra- and inter-group) as well as the provision environment (smaller groups with higher individual benefits from cooperation vs. larger groups with lower individual benefits from cooperation). Irrespective of the provision environment groups with an inter-group comparison opportunity exhibited a significantly stronger cooperation than groups without this opportunity. Participants conditionally cooperated within their group and additionally acted to advance their group to not fall behind the other group. The individual efforts to advance the own group cushion the downward trend in the above average contributors and thus render contributions on a higher level. We discuss areas of practical application.}

In contrast to most public-goods games that assume group returns are linear in individual contributions, the present model assumes decreasing marginal group production as a function of aggregate individual contributions. This diminishing marginal returns assumption is more realistic and generates starkly different predictions compared to the linear model. One important implication is that, under most conditions, there exist equilibria where some, but not all, members of a group contribute, even with completely self-interested motives. An agent-based simulation confirmed the individual and group advantages of the equilibria in which behavioral asymmetry emerges from a game structure that is a priori perfectly symmetric for all agents (all agents have the same payoff function and action space but take different actions in equilibria). A behavioral experiment demonstrated that cooperators and free riders coexist in a stable manner in groups performing with the nonlinear production function. A collateral result demonstrated that, compared to a dictatorial decision scheme guided by the best member in a group, the majority/plurality decision rules can pool information effectively and produce greater individual net welfare at equilibrium, even if free riding is not sanctioned. This is an original proof that cooperation in ad hoc decision-making groups can be understood in terms of self-interested motivations and that, despite the free-rider problem, majority/plurality decision rules can function robustly as simple, efficient social decision heuristics.}

Recent theoretical models propose the coevolution of parochial altruism and intergroup conflict, when in-group altruism and out-group hostility contribute to the group’s success in these conflicts. However, the few empirical attempts to test this hypothesis do not use natural groups and conflate measures of in-group and unbiased cooperative behaviour. We conducted field experiments based on naturalistic measures of cooperation (school/ charity donations and lost letters’ returns) with two religious groups with an on-going history of conflict—Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. Conflict was associated with reduced donations to out-group schools and the return of out-group letters, but we found no evidence that it influences ingroup cooperation. Rather, socio-economic status was the major determinant of cooperative behaviour. Our study presents a challenge to dominant perspectives on the origins of human cooperation, and has implications for initiatives aiming to promote conflict resolution and social cohesion.}

In order to succeed, members of the same group have incentives to cooperate with each other by expending individual efforts. However, since effort is costly, each member also has an incentive to abstain from expending any effort and instead free-ride on the efforts of other members. Contest theory shows that the intensity of competition between groups and the amount of freeriding within groups depend on the group size, sharing rule, group impact function, contest success function, and heterogeneity of players. We review experimental studies testing these theoretical predictions. Almost all studies of behavior in group contests find significant overexpenditure of effort relative to the theory. We discuss potential explanations for such overexpenditure, including the utility of winning, bounded rationality, relative payoff maximization, parochial altruism, and social identity. Despite over-expenditure, most studies find support for the comparative statics predictions of the theory (with the exception of the “group size paradox”). Finally, studies show that there are effective mechanisms that can promote withingroup cooperation and conflict resolution mechanisms that can de-escalate and potentially eliminate between-group conflict.}

This claim has important implications, but little direct support. This research investigates how intergroup conflict shapes individuals’ tendencies to sacrifice for their groups, enforce norms by sanctioning their peers, and relinquish decision- making autonomy to a leader. I test the predictions with two small group experiments, which find that conflict increases enforcement of norms when outgroup participation in conflict is high and increases contribution to the group regardless of outgroup participation in conflict. Evidence on support for leaders is mixed and suggests that the performance of the group may affect support for leaders.}

In study 2, both Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs similarly devalued a Palestinian plan when it was ascribed to the “other side.” Furthermore, both Arabs and Jewish “hawks” (but not Jewish “doves”) perceived a proposal attributed to the dovish Israeli government as relatively bad for their own people and good for their adversaries. Study 3 explored the role that differences in construal of proposal terms play in mediating “reactive devaluation.” These studies expand theoretical understanding of this devaluation phenomenon and the barrier it creates to the resolution of real-world conflicts.}

It is suggested that such positive expressions by an adversary will have positive effects on reconciliation only in the presence of a basic level of trust in the outgroup. In two studies, Israeli-Jewish participants were exposed to a Palestinian leader who either expressed or did not express empathy and/or Palestinian responsibility for Israelis’ suffering. After reading the speech, participants completed a questionnaire that measured their attitudes toward reconciliation with Palestinians. Results of both studies show that whereas expression of empathy led to more positive attitudes when trust was high, it tended to have adverse effects when trust was low. Similar effects were not found for assumed responsibility. Implications for research on intergroup conflict and reconciliation are discussed}

Previous work identified reactive devaluation in the context of the Cold War (Stillinger, et al., 1990) and the Israel-Palestinian conflict (Maoz, et al., 2002). Both studies identified the tendency of respondents to negatively evaluate proposals based on antagonistic authorship; however, both studies were conducted in the context of a high threat/low trust situation. Without a variance in the psychological context, it becomes difficult to isolate the causal mechanisms which trigger reactive devaluation. We improve upon this literature by testing the phenomenon of reactive devaluation in the context of the Iranian nuclear deal (perceived to be a low threat situation by respondents), and explore the impact of trust and fear upon the tendency of respondents to reactively devalue the terms of the proposal. We fin d that threat level affects the willingness to accept a peace proposal and that reactive devaluation continues to operate even in the absence of an existential threat. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, threat level or trust in the antagonist does not indirectly condition the effect of reactive devaluation in a significant manner.}

The current status of realistic group conflict theory is evaluated in terms of its theoretical structure, scientific rigor, and ability to fulfill theoretical functions. Finally, some future directions for the theory are outlined. It is concluded that the theory and its underlying philosophy have much to offer to efforts to reduce current and prevent future eruptions of intergroup hostilities.}

Among our results, we show that under some weak conditions, there is no equilibrium of any crisis bargaining game that has voluntary agreements and zero probability of costly war. We also show that while uncertainty about the other side’s cost of war may be relatively benign in peace negotiations, uncertainty about the other side’s strength in war makes it much more difficult to guarantee peaceful outcomes. Along the way, we are able to assess the degree to which particular modeling assumptions found in the existing literature drive the well-known relationship between uncertainty, the incentive to misrepresent, and costly war. We find that while the theoretical connection between war and uncertainty is quite robust to relaxing many modeling assumptions, whether uncertainty is about costs or the probability of victory remains important}
