@article{rosenbaum2002,
	abstract = {An effect is attributable to treatment if it would not have been observed had the individual been exposed to control instead. Extending earlier results on attributable effects in unmatched groups, a method of exact randomization inference and sensitivity analysis is developed for case-referent, case-crossover, and cohort studies with matched sets, and a large sample approximation to the exact inference is given. The unmatched case, considered previously, has certain symmetries that the matched case, considered here, does not have. As a result, approximation for the matched case requires the use of the recently developed method of asymptotic separability, which was riot needed in the unmatched case. Several examples are presented, including a case-referent study of Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of myocardial infarction, a case-crossover study of alcohol as a cause of injury, a cohort study of women who gave birth at home, and a study of the effects of cadmium exposure with a continuous outcome measuring kidney function. Unlike tests of no effect, inference about attributable effects has a different form in case-referent and cohort studies.},

@article{rosenbaum1993hlp,
	abstract = {A Hodges-Lehmann point estimate of an additive treatment effect is a robust estimate derived from the randomization distribution of a rank test. This article shows how to carry out a sensitivity analysis for such an estimate in an observational study where treatments are not randomly assigned. Two cases are discussed in detail: matched pairs and the comparison of two unmatched groups. The method uses a model for the distribution of treatment assignments when hidden biases may be present. This model has previously been used for sensitivity analysis of significance levels and confidence intervals.},
