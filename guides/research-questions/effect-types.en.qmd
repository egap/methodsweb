This guide describes estimands, theoretical parameters of interest, of researchers might want to identify. This guide should be used to help researchers choose an estimand of interest to address their specific research question.

1. Effects as contrasts between outcomes
==
Effects are, at their core, a comparison of potential outcomes. Researchers in every field are interested in the effect of X on Y, how does some intervention change the outcome for person i? For people on average? Effects need not be a difference between two outcomes, instead they could be, for example, ratios of two values. All that constitutes an effect is comparing the potential outcomes without a treatment to the potential outcome without a treatment in some way. A handful of potential estimands, theoretical effects one might be interested in, are described here.

2. Individual treatment effects
==
A first quantity of interest is the individual treatment effect. For this estimand a researcher would be interested in the effect of a treatment on each individual. Individual, in this context, is referencing the level at which analysis is done. This could be a person, a household, a city, or any other level at which analysis is conducted. In order to find this effect, one would want to observe the potential outcome under treatment $Y_i(1)$ and the potential outcome under control $Y_i(0)$. Taking the difference between these quantities would give the individual treatment effect for subject i. $$τ_{i}=Y_{i}(1)−Y_{i}(0)$$ Since we can only observe either $Y_{i}(1)$ or $Y_{i}(0)$ the individual treatment effect is unknowable. 

3. Average treatment effects
==

A quantity that we can learn about, however, is the average treatment effect (ATE) across all observations in our experiment:

$$\mathrm{ATE}≡\frac{1}{N}∑^{N}_{i=1}τ_{i}=\frac{∑^{N}_{1}Y_{i}(1)}{N}−\frac{∑^{N}_{1}Y_{i}(0)}{N}$$
Importantly, the average treatment effect gives the mean of the treatment effects for *all* units.

See [10 Strategies for Figuring out if X Causes Y](https://methods.egap.org/guides/causal-inference/x-cause-y_en.html) for information on how we can estimate the ATE (and other estimands).

4. Population and sample average treatment effects
==
When defining the average treatment effect, it isn't immediately clear who is included in the *all* part of all subjects. Often we want to generalize from our sample to make statements about some broader population of interest.[^1] Let $S_i$ be an indicator for whether an subject is in our sample. The sample average treatment effect (SATE) is defined simply as $SATE = E(Y_i(1)−Y_i(0)|S_i=1)$ and the population $PATE = E(Y_i(1)−Y_i(0))$. If we are interested in the effect of the treatment within our sample, we would be interested in the sample average treatment effect. For generalizing our results, we would instead be interested in the population average treatment effect. With a large random sample from a well-defined population with full compliance with treatment, our SATE and PATE are equal in expectation.[^2]

5. Conditional average treatment effects
==
The problem with looking at average treatment effects only is that it takes attention away from the fact that treatment effects might be very different for different sorts of people. While the “fundamental problem of causal inference” suggests that measuring causal effects for individual units is impossible, making inferences on groups of units is not.

Random assignment ensures that treatment is independent of potential outcomes and any (observed and unobserved) covariates. Sometimes, however, we have additional information about the experimental units as they existed before the experiment was fielded, say $X_{i}$, and this information can can help us understand how treatment effects vary across subgroups. For example, we may suspect that men and women respond differently to treatment, and we can test for this hetorogeneity by estimating conditional ATE for each subgroup separately. We can define the conditional average treatment effect as: $$CATE=E(Y_{i}(1)−Y_{i}(0)∣D_{i},X_{i})$$

For some research questions we often need to know the effects of the treatment not just on the whole population but specifically for those to whom the treatment is administered. We define the average effects of treatment among the treated (ATT) and the control (ATC) as simple counter-factual comparisons:

$$ATT=E(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|D_i=1)=E(Y_i(1)|D_i=1)-E(Y_i(0)|D_i=1)$$
$$ATC=E(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|D_i=0)=E(Y_i(1)|D_i=0)-E(Y_i(0)|D_i=0)$$

Informally, the ATT is the effect for those that we treated; ATC is what the effect *would* be for those we did not treat.


6. Intent-to-treat effects
==
Outside of a controlled laboratory setting, the subjects we assign to treatment often are not the same as the subjects who actually receive the treatment. We call this issue non-compliance[^3]. The intent-to-treat effect (ITT) is the effect of giving someone the opportunity to receive treatment. In the absence of noncompliance, the ITT is the same as the ATE. We can define ITT as:

$$\mathrm{ITT} = E[Y_i(z=1)] - E[Y_i(z=0)]$$

[^3]: See [10 Things You Need to Know About the Local Average Treatment Effect](https://methods.egap.org/guides/research-questions/late_en.html) for more on non-compliance.

Where z is an indicator for whether a subject has been *assigned* to treatment rather than indicating whether they *received* treatment. 

With two-sided non-compliance ITT can be written as:


\begin{align}
ITT =& E[Y_i(d(1)) - Y_i(d(0))|d_i(1)=d_i(0)=0]\pi_{NT} + \nonumber \\
&E[Y_i(d(1)) - Y_i(d(0))|d_i(1)=d_i(0)=1]\pi_{AT} + \nonumber \\
&E[Y_i(d(1)) - Y_i(d(0))|d_i(1)-d_i(0)=1]\pi_{C} + \nonumber \\
&E[Y_i(d(1)) - Y_i(d(0))|d_i(1)-d_i(0)=-1]\pi_{D} \nonumber
\end{align}


Where $d_i(z)$ returns 1 if the subject receives treatment for the given assignment $z$ and 0 if they do not receive treatment for that assignment.

7. Complier average causal effects
==
What if you are interested in figuring out the effects of a treatment on those people who actually took up the treatment and not just those people that were administered the treatment? In this case, you would be interested in the complier average causal effect (CACE).


$$CACE= E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|d_i(1)-d_i(0) = 1]$$

Which is the average effect conditional on the subject being a complier, a type that takes the treatment when assigned to treatment and does not take the treatment when assigned to control.


8. Average marginal component effect
==

For a conjoint experiment (see [10 Things to Know About Survey Experiments](https://methods.egap.org/guides/data-strategies/survey-experiments_en.html)), one might be interested in the marginal effect of changing one attribute. The average marginal component effect (AMCE) gives  the average causal effect of changing an attribute from one value to another, while holding equal the joint distribution of the other attributes in the design, averaged over this distribution.

The probabilities associated with each factor are also informed by the choice of estimand. For the uniform AMCE (uAMCE),  each factor is independently and uniformly marginalized. In contrast, the population AMCE (pAMCE) is marginalized over the target population distribution of profiles. The AMCE is always defined with respect to the distribution used for the random assignment; so if you change the randomization distribution, the interpretation changes.


9. Direct and indirect effects
==

When discussing the effects of a treatment, one could be interested in the total effect of the treatment on the outcome, as assumed above, or components of the effect of the treatment. Specifically, one might be interested in the direct effect of the treatment or any number of indirect effects of a treatment. Largely, interest in direct and indirect effects comes from an interest in [mechanisms](https://methods.egap.org/guides/research-questions/mechanisms_en.html). It might be of interest to a researcher *how* the effect happens, rather than simply knowing whether all of the mechanisms together produce an effect.

When trying to decompose an effect into the components of indirect and direct effects, one might look to mediation analysis. Suppose that there is one mediator, potential outcomes can now be written as $Y_i(z)=Y_i(z,M_i(z))$, where z is the treatment status and $M_i(z)$ is a function for how the mediator responds to a given treatment assignment. Writing out the total effect in direct and indirect effects gives the following:

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} = \underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(1))-Y_i(1,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}}+\underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(0))-Y_i(0,M_i(0))}_{\text{Direct Effect}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Equivalently,

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} = \underbrace{Y_i(0,M_i(1))-Y_i(0,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}}+\underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(1))-Y_i(0,M_i(1))}_{\text{Direct Effect}} \nonumber
\end{align}

10. Eliminated effect
==

When interested in indirect effects, one potential estimand is the eliminated effect. From section 9 it is clear to see that getting at the indirect effect is, at minimum, challenging. It is not immediately clear what it means to have the mediator respond to the treatment without the treatment being received as in $Y_i(0,M_i(1))$. These cross-world potential outcomes are not possible to observe.

Despite this difficulty, it might be possible in some settings to manipulate the mediator, getting at controlled direct effects, where the researcher forces the mediator to respond in a certain way. Let the potential outcome where the subject is assigned to treatment and the mediator is forced to respond as if assigned to control be written as $Y_i(10)$. The eliminated effect is the total effect minus the controlled direct effect.

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} &- \underbrace{Y_i(10)-Y_i(00)}_{\text{Controlled Direct Effect}} \nonumber \\ 
&= \underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(1))-Y_i(1,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}} \nonumber \\
&+ \underbrace{[(Y_i(11)-Y_i(01)) - (Y_i(10)- Y_i(00))]*M_i(0)}_{\text{Mediated Interaction}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Equivalently:

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} &- \underbrace{Y_i(10)-Y_i(00)}_{\text{Controlled Direct Effect}} \nonumber \\ 
&= \underbrace{Y_i(0,M_i(1))-Y_i(0,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}} \nonumber \\
&+ \underbrace{[(Y_i(11)-Y_i(01)) - (Y_i(10)- Y_i(00))]*M_i(1)}_{\text{Mediated Interaction}} \nonumber
\end{align}

This effect can be observed, as both the total effect and the controlled direct effect can be obtained so long as the mediator is able to be manipulated.
