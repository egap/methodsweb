This guide describes estimands, theoretical parameters of interest, of
researchers might want to identify. This guide should help researchers choose
an estimand of interest to address their specific research question. It builds
on [10 Things to Know About Causal
Inference](https://methods.egap.org/guides/causal-inference/causal-inference_en.html).


1. Causal effects as comparisons between potential outcomes
==

If a person who took an aspirin would have had a worse headache if she had not
taken the aspirin, then we say that the aspirin caused an improvement in her
headache. That is, the outcome for this suffering person after taking an
aspirin could have been either a bad headache or a mild headache. But the
aspirin caused her to experience, an a researcher to observe, a mild headache
rather than the potential bad headache. This is an illustration of what we mean
when we say that causal effects are comparisons of potential outcomes (see our
guide on  [10 Things to Know About Causal
Inference](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-causal-inference/)
to learn more about potential outcomes.

Researchers in every field are interested causal effects. Sometimes interest
focuses on the average (say the average difference in headache severity across
multiple people), or perhaps some other quantity like a ratio. This guide
describes a few common causal effects that focus on averages.


2. Individual treatment effects
==

A first quantity of interest is the individual treatment effect. For this
estimand a researcher would be interested in the effect of a treatment on each
individual's outcome. An individual could be a person, a household, a city, or
any other level at which outcomes are measured. In the aspirin example, we
could write $Z_i=1$ to indicate that person $i$ took an aspirin and $Z_i=0$ to
mean that person did not take an aspirin. We use the variable $Z$ to refer to
the experimental treatment and $Y$ will be the outcome.

In order to see an effect of a treatment on a person's outcome, one would want
to observe that person's potential outcome under treatment $Y_i(Z_i=1)$ (which
we write $Y_i(1)$ as a shorthand) and the potential outcome under control
$Y_i(0)$. Taking the difference between these quantities would give the
additive individual treatment effect for subject i: $τ_{i}=Y_{i}(1)−Y_{i}(0)$.
If we wanted to learn about the effect of a treatment on a ratio of outcomes
(say, income was the outcome), we would write $\tau_{i}=Y_{i}(1)/Y_{i}(0)$ as
another individual treatment effect. Since we can only observe either
$Y_{i}(1)$ or $Y_{i}(0)$ these individual treatment effects (and any others
using those two potential outcomes) are unknowable although we can hypothesize
about individual treatment effects and test those hypotheses and/or we can
estimate individual treatment effects using models of outcomes.^[See our [10
Things to Know about Hypothesis
Testing](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-hypothesis-testing/)
to learn about hypothesis testing for causal inference.]


3. Average treatment effects
==

Some reseachers want to learn about the average treatment effect (ATE) across all observations in our experiment. Which we can define as the average of the individual level additive treatment effects across all units in the study.

$$ATE≡\frac{1}{N}∑^{N}_{i=1}τ_{i}=\frac{∑^{N}_{1}Y_{i}(1)}{N}−\frac{∑^{N}_{1}Y_{i}(0)}{N}$$

See [10 Strategies for Figuring out if X Causes Y](https://methods.egap.org/guides/causal-inference/x-cause-y_en.html) for information on how we can **estimate** the ATE.[^1]

4. Population and sample average treatment effects
==

When defining the average treatment effect, it isn't immediately clear which
units should be included in the *all* part of *all units*. Often we want to use
our sample to make statements about some broader population.[^2] Let $S_i$ be
an indicator for whether an subject is in our sample. The sample average
treatment effect (SATE) is defined simply as $SATE = E(Y_i(1)−Y_i(0)|S_i=1)$
and the population $PATE = E(Y_i(1)−Y_i(0))$. If we are interested in the
effect of the treatment within our sample, we would be interested in the sample
average treatment effect. For estimating the effect of the treatment on units
that we do not observe but which we could observe, we would instead be
interested in the population average treatment effect. With a large random
sample from a well-defined population with full compliance with treatment, our
SATE and PATE are equal in expectation.[^3]

5. Conditional average treatment effects
==

Sometimes the theory or policy intervention motivating the study suggests that the treatment effect should differ for different sorts of people.

Random assignment ensures that treatment is independent of potential outcomes and any (observed and unobserved) covariates.^[TODO link to an appropriate guide] Sometimes, however, we have additional information about the experimental units as they existed *before* the experiment was fielded. We can call such a baseline variable or "covariate", $X_{i}$.  This information can can help us understand how treatment effects vary across subgroups. For example, we may suspect that men and women respond differently to treatment, and we can define an estimand that will have different values for each subgroup separately. We can define the conditional average treatment effect as:

$$CATE=E(Y_{i}(1)−Y_{i}(0)∣Z_{i},X_{i})$$

A version of a conditional ATE are the average treatment effects defined
specifically for those to whom the treatment is administered. We define the
average effects of treatment among the treated (ATT) and the control (ATC) as
follows:

$$ATT=E(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|Z_i=1)=E(Y_i(1)|Z_i=1)-E(Y_i(0)|Z_i=1)$$
$$ATC=E(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|Z_i=0)=E(Y_i(1)|Z_i=0)-E(Y_i(0)|Z_i=0)$$

Informally, the ATT is the effect for those that we treated; ATC is what the effect *would* be for those we did not treat.

Those interested in further reading on conditional average treatment effects should see chapter 9 of @gerber_green_2012.

6. Intent-to-treat effects
==

Outside of a controlled laboratory setting, the subjects we assign to treatment
often are not the same as the subjects who actually receive the treatment. For
example, a public health agency could send postcards to people to  encourage
people to take aspirins when they have a headache, but they cannot force people
to swallow the pills. Some people will take a pill because they were encouraged
to do so by the postcards, but other will not comply with the instructions. We
call this issue noncompliance[^4]. The intent-to-treat effect (ITT) is the
effect of giving someone the opportunity to receive treatment. In the absence
of noncompliance, the ITT is the same as the ATE. We can define ITT as:

$$ITT = E[Y_i(Z=1)] - E[Y_i(Z=0)]$$

[^4]: See [10 Things You Need to Know About the Local Average Treatment Effect](https://methods.egap.org/guides/research-questions/late_en.html) for more on non-compliance.

Where $Z$ is an indicator for whether a subject has been *assigned* to treatment rather than indicating whether they *received* treatment.

What if you are interested in figuring out the effects of a treatment on those people who actually took up the treatment and not just those people that were administered the treatment? In this case, you would be interested in the complier average causal effect (CACE) or local average treatment effect (LATE). If we write $D_i(Z_i=1)=1$ to mean that a person would take a "dose" of an assigned treatment and $D_i(Z_i=0)=0$ to mean that a person would not take a dose of a treatment if it was not assigned, we can write the CACE as:

$$CACE= E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|D_i(1)-D_i(0) = 1]$$

Which is the average effect conditional on the subject being a complier, a type that takes the treatment when assigned to treatment and does not take the treatment when assigned to control.[^6]

[^6]: Detailed discussion of both ITT and CACE can be found in chapters 5 and 6 of @gerber_green_2012.


7. Quantile Average Treatment Effects
==

The ATE focuses on the effect for a typical person, but we often also care about the distributional consequences of our treatment. We want to know not just whether our treatment raised average income, but also whether it made the distribution of income in the study more or less equal.

Claims about distributions are difficult. Even though we can estimate the ATE from a difference of sample means, in general, we cannot make statements about the joint distribution of potential outcomes $(F(Y_i(1),Y_i(0)))$ without further assumptions. Typically, these assumptions either limit our analysis to a specific sub-population[^17] or require us to assume some form of rank invariance in the distribution of responses to treatment effects.[^18]

[^17]: Abadie, Angrist, and Imbens (2002)

[^18]:Chernozhukov and Hansen (2005). That is, treatment can have heterogeneous effects but the ordering of potential outcomes is preserved. See Angrist and Pischke  Angrist, Joshua, and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2008. Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist’s Companion. Princeton university press.  See Frölich and Melly (2010) for fairly concise discussions of these issues and Abbring and Heckman (Abbring, Jaap H, and James J Heckman. 2007. “Econometric Evaluation of Social Programs, Part III: Distributional Treatment Effects, Dynamic Treatment Effects, Dynamic Discrete Choice, and General Equilibrium Policy Evaluation.” Handbook of Econometrics 6. Elsevier: 5145–5303.) (2007) for a thorough overview.

If these assumptions are justified for our data, we can obtain consistent estimates of quantile treatment effects (QTE) using quantile regression.[^19] Just as linear regression estimates the ATE as a difference in means (or, when covariates are used in the model, from a conditional mean), quantile regression fits a linear model to a conditional quantile and this model can then be used to estimates the effects of treatment for that particular quantile of the outcome. The approach can be extended to include covariates and instruments for non-compliance. Note that the interpretation of the QTE is for a given quantile, not an individual at that quantile.

8. Average marginal component effect
==

For a conjoint experiment (see [10 Things to Know About Survey Experiments](https://methods.egap.org/guides/data-collection/survey-experiments_en.html)), one might be interested in the marginal effect of changing one attribute. The average marginal component effect (AMCE) gives  the average causal effect of changing an attribute from one value to another, while holding equal the joint distribution of the other attributes in the design, averaged over this distribution.

The probabilities associated with each factor are also informed by the choice of estimand. For the uniform AMCE (uAMCE),  each factor is independently and uniformly marginalized. In contrast, the population AMCE (pAMCE) is marginalized over the target population distribution of profiles. The AMCE is always defined with respect to the distribution used for the random assignment; so if you change the randomization distribution, the interpretation changes.[^7]

9. Direct and indirect effects and Eliminated Effects
==

When discussing the effects of a treatment, one could be interested in the total effect of the treatment on the outcome, as assumed above, or components of the effect of the treatment. Specifically, one might be interested in the direct effect of the treatment or any number of indirect effects of a treatment. Largely, interest in direct and indirect effects comes from an interest in [mechanisms](https://methods.egap.org/guides/research-questions/mechanisms_en.html). It might be of interest to a researcher *how* the effect happens, rather than simply knowing whether all of the mechanisms together produce an effect.

When trying to decompose an effect into the components of indirect and direct effects, one might look to mediation analysis. Suppose that there is one mediator, potential outcomes can now be written as $Y_i(Z_i)=Y_i(Z_i,M_i(Z_i))$, where $Z_i$ is the treatment status (say, $Z_i=1$ or $Z_i=0$) and $M_i(Z_i)$ is a function for how the mediator responds to a given treatment assignment. Writing out the total effect in direct and indirect effects gives the following:

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} = \underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(1))-Y_i(1,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}}+\underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(0))-Y_i(0,M_i(0))}_{\text{Direct Effect}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Equivalently,

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} = \underbrace{Y_i(0,M_i(1))-Y_i(0,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}}+\underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(1))-Y_i(0,M_i(1))}_{\text{Direct Effect}} \nonumber
\end{align}

See @glynn2021advances for more about mediation analysis.

When interested in indirect effects, one potential estiamnd is the eliminated effect. From section 9 it is clear to see that getting at the indirect effect is, at minimum, challenging. It is not immediately clear what it means to have the mediator respond to the treatment without the treatment being received as in $Y_i(0,M_i(1))$. These cross-world potential outcomes are not possible to observe.

Despite this difficulty, it might be possible in some settings to manipulate the mediator, getting at controlled direct effects, where the researcher forces the mediator to respond in a certain way. Let the potential outcome where the subject is assigned to treatment and the mediator is forced to respond as if assigned to control be written as $Y_i(1,0)$. The eliminated effect is the total effect minus the controlled direct effect.

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} &- \underbrace{Y_i(1,0)-Y_i(0,0)}_{\text{Controlled Direct Effect}} \nonumber \\
&= \underbrace{Y_i(1,M_i(1))-Y_i(1,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}} \nonumber \\
&+ \underbrace{[(Y_i(1,1)-Y_i(0,1)) - (Y_i(1,0)- Y_i(0,0))]*M_i(0)}_{\text{Mediated Interaction}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Equivalently:

\begin{align}
\underbrace{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}_{\text{Total Effect}} &- \underbrace{Y_i(10)-Y_i(00)}_{\text{Controlled Direct Effect}} \nonumber \\
&= \underbrace{Y_i(0,M_i(1))-Y_i(0,M_i(0))}_{\text{Indirect Effect}} \nonumber \\
&+ \underbrace{[(Y_i(1,1)-Y_i(0,1)) - (Y_i(1,0)- Y_i(0,0))]*M_i(1)}_{\text{Mediated Interaction}} \nonumber
\end{align}

This effect can be observed, as both the total effect and the controlled direct effect can be obtained so long as the mediator is able to be manipulated.[^8]

10. Treatment Effects for Binary Outcomes: Log-Odds Treatment Effects and Attributable Effects
==
Average treatment effects seem a bit hard to interpret when outcomes are not continuous. For example, a very common binary outcome in the study of elections is coded as 1 when subjects voted, and 0 when they did not. The average effect might be 0.2, but what does it really mean to say that a treatment increased voting by 0.2 for individual? Estimating causal effects for dichotomous outcomes requires some additional care, particularly when including covariates. A common quantity of causal interest for dichotomous outcomes is our treatment’s effect on the log-odds of success, defined for the experimental pool as:

$$\Delta = log\frac{E(Y_i(1))}{1-E(Y_i(1))} - log\frac{E(Y_i(0))}{1-E(Y_i(0))}$$

@freemand_2008b shows that the coefficient from a logistic regression adjusting for covariates in a randomized experiments produces biased estimates of this causal effect. The basic intuition for Freedman’s argument comes from the fact that taking the log of averages is not the same as taking the average of logs and so the treatment coefficient estimated from a logistic regression conditioning on covariates will not provide a consistent estimator of log-odds of success. Instead, Freedman recommends taking the predicted probabilities varying subjects’ treatment status but maintaining their observed covariate profiles to produce a consistent estimator of the log-odds.

An alternative approach with binary outcomes is to infer about the *sum* of successes rather than the difference in proportions. @rosenbaum_2002a introduces this quantity in the context of matched observational studies and @hansen_bowers_2009 use it in a randomized field experiment where voting or not voting is measured at the individual level.

Consider a simple case with a dichotomous outcome and treatment. Let $A$ be the number of outcomes attributable to treatment, that is, the number of cases in which $Y_i$ equaled 1 among treated subjects which would not have occurred had these units been assigned to control. For a range of $A$’s, we adjust the observed contingency table of outcomes among the treated, and compare this resulting distribution to a known null distribution (the distribution of outcomes we would have observed had treatment had no effect). The resulting range of $A$’s for which our test continues to reject the null hypothesis of no effect provides a range of effects that are attributable to our treatment.

Table 1|$D=1$              |$D=0$
-------|-------------------|--------------
$Y=1$  |$\sum Y_iD_i-A$    |$(1-Y_i)(D_i)$
$Y=0$  |$\sum Y_i(1-D_i)+A$|$\sum (1-Y_i)(1-D_i)$


First, we define an attributable effect as $A=∑_iZ_iτ_i$, where $τ_i=Y_i(1)−Y_i(0)$ and $y∈0,1$. That is, the attributable effect is the number of “yes” or “success” or other “1” responses among those treated that we would not have seen if they had been assigned control.

Second, notice that if we write the set $U$ as the experimental pool, and the set of control units is a subset of the whole pool, $C⊆U$, then we can write $∑_{i∈C}Y_i−Y_i(0)=0$. This means that we can represent $A$ using totals:

$$A = ∑_{i=1}^NZ_iτ_i=∑_{i=1}^NZ_i(Y_i(1)−Y_i(0))=∑_{i∉C}Y_i(1)−∑_{i∉C}Y_i(0)$$
$$  = ∑_{i∉C}Y_i−∑_{i∉C}Y_i(0)=∑_{i=1}^NY_i−∑_{i=1}^NY_i(0)=t_U−t_C$$
<center>
= observed total overall (fixed and observed) - total outcome under control (unobserved, to estimate)
</center>

Third, this representation allows us to produce a design-based confidence interval for $\hat{A}$ by drawing on the survey sampling literature about statistical inference for sample totals because the observed total number of successful outcomes (the total number of people voting in the example), $t_U$,  is fixed across randomizations.
