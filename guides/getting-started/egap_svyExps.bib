  abstract      = {We develop a new method for blocking in randomized
		  experiments that works for an arbitrary number of
		  treatments. We analyze the following prob- lem: given a
		  threshold for the minimum number of units to be contained
		  in a block, and given a distance measure between any two
		  units in the finite population, block the units so that the
		  maximum distance between any two units within a block is
		  minimized. This blocking criterion can minimize covariate
		  imbalance, which is a common goal in experimental design.
		  Find- ing an optimal blocking is an NP-hard problem.
		  However, using ideas from graph theory, we provide the
		  first polynomial time approximately optimal blocking
		  algorithm for this problem. We derive the variances of
		  estimators for sample average treatment effects under the
		  Neyman-Rubin potential out- comes model for arbitrary
		  blocking assignments and an arbitrary number of treatments.

Similarity of the covert model to the avoidant subject was examined in a 2×2 design combining two levels of fear-irrelevant model similarity (model of same age and sex as the subject versus model who was much older and of opposite sex) and fear-relevant model similarity (coping versus mastery model). 

In two sessions, subjects imagined scenes in which the covert model interacted with the feared stimulus. A no-model control group, which imagined fear-related scenes in the absence of a model, was included in the design. Fear-irrelevant similarity contributed reliably to avoidance reduction. A behavioral measure of avoidance and self-report measures of affect and attitudes indicated that imagination of a model similar in age and same sexed led to greater changes than a model dissimilar on these dimensions. Fear-relevant similarity led to few reliable changes in avoidance. 

The greatest vicarious learning tended to occur in subjects who imagined a model similar in fear-related and nonfear-related dimensions. The results were found at posttreatment and at a 2- to 3-week follow-up.},

  abstract  = {Can positive social contact between members of antagonistic groups reduce prejudice and discrimination?
Despite extensive research on social contact, observational studies are difficult to interpret
because prejudiced people may select out of contact with out-group members.We overcome this
problem by conducting an education-based, randomized field experiment—the Urban Youth Vocational
Training program (UYVT)—with 849 randomly sampled Christian and Muslim young men in riot-prone
Kaduna, Nigeria. After sixteen weeks of positive intergroup social contact, we find no changes in prejudice,
but heterogeneous-class subjects discriminate significantly less against out-group members than
subjects in homogeneous classes.We trace this finding to increased discrimination by homogeneous-class
subjects compared to non-UYVT study participants, and we highlight potentially negative consequences
of in-group social contact. By focusing on skill-building instead of peace messaging, our intervention
minimizes reporting bias and offers strong experimental evidence that intergroup social contact can alter
behavior in constructive ways, even amid violent conflict.},

I say, sure.  But do we need to SEE a causal process, or do we just come up with a causal process when we notice things covarying?

Entertainment media offers a unique and cost-effective channel of reaching millions of viewers with financial education messages that resonate. This paper uses random and symmetric encouragement methodology to study the economic impact of targeted messages on debt management and gambling scripted in a popular television soap opera in South Africa. The results show treated viewers score significantly higher on financial knowledge, are more likely to borrow from formal sources and for productive purposes, and are less likely to enter into retail credit or gamble. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of mechanisms show strong recall of messages conveyed by the lead character, which supports theories of psychological and emotional influences on decision-making.

affect intergroup relations. However, little is known about the relative strengths of the generalization of negative and positive
interpersonal attitudes into attitudes about the outgroup. The unique contribution of negative (disliking) interpersonal
attitudes to intergroup attitudes was examined and its strength was compared with the effect of positive (liking) interpersonal
attitudes, using cross-sectional (Study 1; N = 733, age 10-12) and longitudinal data (Study 2; N = 960, age 12-13). Disliking
uniquely contributed to respondents’ outgroup attitudes. The generalization of interpersonal liking and disliking was about
equally strong in both studies. This underpins the importance of examining the effects of both positive and negative intergroup
contact experiences on the formation of outgroup attitudes.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis
with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically
reduces prejudice (mean r =−.21). Allport’s original conditions for optimal contact –
equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction – facilitate
the effect but are not necessary conditions. 

There are other positive outcomes of intergroup
contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. 

These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled
and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these
effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to
the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact.
They also appear to be universal – across nations, genders, and age groups. 

The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect
contact reduces prejudice – vicarious contact through the mass media and having a
friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs – especially when it
is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also
discussed.},

The degree of threat of the group was varied by informing participants that the group represented a small (4%) or substantial (40%) proportion of the population living in the area. Consistent with the Group Attribution Error literature, the outcome of the vote influenced participants’ inferences about the extremity of the voters’ attitude. More positive (negative) attitudes were inferred in the case of a positive (negative) outcome of the vote. This effect was qualified by the level of threat. Participants inferred relatively more extreme and more homogeneous attitudes among the members of a threatening group."},

postulates that social motivation drives the kind of information
group members attend to, encode, and retrieve
and that epistemic motivation drives the degree to which
new information is sought and attended to, encoded, and
retrieved. Social motivation and epistemic motivation are
expected to influence, alone and in combination, generating
problem solutions, disseminating information, and
negotiating joint decisions. The MIP-G model integrates
the influence of many individual and situational differences

A structural description of the social amplification of risk is now possible. Amplification occurs at two stages: in the transfer of information about the risk, and in the response mechanisms of society. Signals about risk are processed by individual and social amplification stations, including the scientist who communicates the risk assessment, the news media, cultural groups, interpersonal networks, and others. Key steps of amplifications can be identified at each stage. The amplified risk leads to behavioral responses, which, in turn, result in secondary impacts"},

problems in social cognitive science. Although no other
concept is invoked more frequently in the social
sciences, we still know little about how social norms
are formed, the forces determining their content, and
the cognitive and emotional requirements that enable a
species to establish and enforce social norms. In recent
years, there has been substantial progress, however, on
how cooperation norms are enforced. Here we review
evidence showing that sanctions are decisive for norm
enforcement, and that they are largely driven by nonselfish
motives. Moreover, the explicit study of sanctioning
behavior provides instruments for measuring
social norms and has also led to deeper insights
into the proximate and ultimate forces behind human
cooperation},

 show experimentally that there is indeed a wide

 the free-riders. Our results indicate that this

 not provide any material benefits for the pun
isher. In addition, we provide evidence that
 free-riders are punished the more heavily the
 more they deviate from the cooperation levels
 of the cooperators. Potential free-riders, there
fore, can avoid or at least reduce punishment by
 increasing their cooperation levels. This, in
 turn, suggests that in the presence of punish
ment opportunities there will be less free riding},

conformitychannel. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in urban Nigeria where
young viewers were exposed to Shuga or to a non-educational TV series. Among those
who watched Shuga, we created additional variation in the social messagesthey received
and in the people with whom they watched the show. We nd signicant improvements
in knowledge and attitudes towards HIV and risky sexual behavior. Treated subjects are
twice as likely to get tested for HIV 6 to 9 months after the intervention. We also nd
reductions in STDs among women. Our experimental manipulations of the social norm
component did not produce signicantly di¤erent results from the main treatment. Also,
we dont detect signicant spillovers on the behavior of friends who did not watch Shuga.
The informatione¤ect of edutainment thus seems to have prevailed in the context of our

  abstract  = {We contrast two theoretical approaches to social influence, one stressing interpersonal
dependence, conceptualized as normative and informational influence (Deutsch &
Gerard, 1955), and the other stressing group membership, conceptualized as selfcategorization
and referent informational influence (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher &
Wetherell, 1987). We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the
existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as
belonging to one's own category. This study tested these two approaches using three
influence paradigms. First we demonstrate that, in Sherifs (1936) autokinetic effect
paradigm, the impact of confederates on the formation of a norm decreases as their
membership of a different category is made more salient to subjects. Second, in the Asch
(1956) conformity paradigm, surveillance effectively exerrs normative pressure ifdone by
an in-group but not by an out-group. In-group influence decreases and out-group
influence increases when subjects respond privately. Self-report data indicate that
in-groupconfederates create more subjective uncertainty than out-group confederates and
public responding seems to increase cohesiveness with in-group - but decrease it with
out-group - sources of influence. In our third experiment we use the group polarization
paradigm (e.g. Bumstein & Vinokur, 1973) to demonstrate that, when categorical
differences between two subgroups within a discussion group are made salient, convergence
of opinion between the subgroups is inhibited. Taken together the experiments
show that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence},

All of the available evidence suggests that the societies of our Pliocene ancestors were like those of other social primates, and this means that human psychology has changed in ways that support larger, more cooperative societies that characterize modern humans. In this paper, we argue that cultural adaptation is a key factor in these changes. Over the last million years or so, people evolved the ability to learn from each other, creating the possibility of cumulative, cultural evolution. Rapid cultural adaptation also leads to persistent differences between local social groups, and then competition between groups leads to the spread of behaviours that enhance their competitive ability. Then, in such culturally evolved cooperative social environments, natural selection within groups favoured genes that gave rise to new, more pro-social motives. Moral systems enforced by systems of sanctions and rewards increased the reproductive success of individuals who functioned well in such environments, and this in turn led to the evolution of other regarding motives like empathy and social emotions like shame.},

that enhanced efforts only emerge when people consider the way

central to understanding media effects, what forms this dialogue, and how does it influence people

which examined an entertainment-education (E-E) programme in India, developed with the intention of
promoting pro-social change (e.g., gender equality, family planning, etc.). We discovered that internal
dialogue (parasocial interaction) between listeners and media characters lead to conversations about
the educational content of the media programme that fuelled support for social stability and for prosocial
change. Second, interpersonal dialogue within families, and dialogue at the group level among
community members, facilitated discussion of sensitive or taboo subjects in ways that were supportive
of social stability as well as social change in family and community dynamics. Finally, listeners and
viewers of E-E programmes confronted powerful forces of resistance as they attempted to change
community power dynamics. Despite these difficulties, our findings suggest that synergistic possibilities
for social action emerge when E-E broadcasts disseminate pro-social models of behaviour that spark
various forms of dialogue among audience members},

This article measures the program’s effectiveness based on a sample of 462 participants and 453 nonparticipants. The results show that the program was successful in producing changes in three of the underlying structural factors of HIV: gender attitudes, gender roles, and HIV stigma.

norm enforcement often emerge in the context of inter-group
conflicts13,14, they are likely to be shaped by parochialism15—a
preference for favouring the members of one’s ethnic, racial or
language group. We have conducted punishment experiments16,
which allow ‘impartial’ observers to punish norm violators, with
indigenous groups in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that these
experiments confirm the prediction of parochialism. We found
that punishers protect ingroup victims—who suffer from a norm
violation—much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless
of the norm violator’s group affiliation. Norm violators also expect
that punishers will be lenient if the latter belong to their social
group. As a consequence, norm violations occur more often if the
punisher and the norm violator belong to the same group. Our
results are puzzling for evolutionary multi-level selection theories
based on selective group extinction2–5 as well as for theories of
individual selection17–19; they also indicate the need to explicitly
examine the interactions between individuals stemming from
different groups in evolutionary models.},

  abstract  = {A principal consequence of mass media coverage about national public affairs issues, particularly from print media, appears to be an increasing "knowledge gap" between various social strata. Previous data presented by the authors were concerned with issues largely external to the local community. More recent work raises the question whether social conflict about a community issue will tend to open the gap further, or close it. Survey data from fifteen Minnesota communities experiencing conflicts of varying magnitude indicate that as level of conflict about local issues increases, the knowledge gap actually tends to decline. Level of interpersonal communication about the issue appears to be a major intervening variable. Thus, it appears that the knowledge gap hypothesis needs to be modified according to the type of issue involved and the conflict dimensions of the issue within the community.},

In the simulation condition, participants imagined life on an alien planet that inadvertently simulated situational constraints parallel to those faced by homosexuals. The simulation (vs. control lecture) produced significantly more intergroup perspective-taking, empathy, and favorable attitudes toward homosexuals and marginalized groups. Tests of a structural equation model supported the assumption that the simulation (vs. control) provided an experience that heightened intergroup perspective-taking, which indirectly predicted favorable attitudes via independent cognitive (inclusive intergroup representations) and affective (empathy) paths. The model held after statistically controlling for prior attitudes and ideological individual differences predicting anti-homosexual bias. Implications for prejudice-reduction simulations and intergroup contact are considered.},

Study 1 shows that both pride and respect are significantly related to self-esteem and group-oriented behaviors in a study based upon people's self-identification with important groups and social categories. Study 2 replicates the same relationships in a context (campus sororities) in which distinctions between and within groups are especially salient and important.

media intervention (a show aiming to promote positive social change), in which fictional characters either
planned collective action (role modeling condition), or did not plan action (control condition) to address grievances.
In Study 1, role modeling affected individual-level outcomes: it increased perceived collective efficacy and
willingness to take action, but exacerbated intergroup attitudes and reduced tolerance. Study 2 tested the influence
of role modeling on a group-level outcome (group discussions). Discussions following the role modeling
show focused less on grievances, and included more positive lessons of the show, as well as more statements
about collective efficacy and collective action. The findings highlight the influence of role modeling of collective
action through media on efficacy and action for social change, but caution against unintended consequences on
intergroup attitudes.},

Otherwise, access to positive legislative performance information actually lowered incumbent vote share.

We address this question by examining the effects of an intergroup contact intervention on ingroup dynamics that may mitigate intergroup conflict. We also examine how outgroup attitudes and psychological resources mediate such effects. We present the results from a difference-in-differences design with 149 Jewish and Arab-Palestinian youth, some of whom participated in an intergroup contact and sports program operated by a nongovernmental organizations in Israel. Our main outcome is one’s tendency to censure ingroup members’ provocations toward the outgroup. As expected, we find a positive impact of the program on ingroup censuring. However, this result is only marginally significant. We find a positive effect of program participation on outgroup attitudes among Jewish youth as expected. To our surprise, among Arab-Palestinian youth, we find a negative effect on outgroup attitudes. Exploring the underlying processes and group-based differences further, we find that outgroup regard mediates the effect of intergroup contact on ingroup censuring for Jewish youth. We find no evidence for mediation among Arab-Palestinian youth but a positive association between ingroup censuring and psychological resources. These results suggest that the psychological conditions of ingroup censuring may differ by group. We discuss implications for peace-building interventions in societies with groups in conflict.},

affect broader conflict dynamics? Given the volume of resources committed
every year to citizen-oriented programs that attempt to promote peace, this is
an important question. We develop a framework to analyze processes through
which individual-level interventions could mitigate violent conflict escalation
more broadly. Individual-level interventions may increase positive feelings toward
the outgroup, as well as psychological, social, and material resources among participants.
These have the potential to influence behaviors such as policing of the
ingroup, public advocacy, and political action that can contribute to peace. Yet, the
effectiveness of interventions to influence the conflict is moderated by contextual
factors like groups’ access to material resources, their positions in society, and
political institutions. We use this analytical framework to assess evidence from
recent intervention studies. We find that the current evidence base is quite small,
does not cover the diversity of relevant contexts, and gives too little attention
to resources and capacities that enable people to engage in conflict mitigation
behaviors. Researchers and policy makers should go beyond thinking only about 
improving attitudes to thinking about behavior, resources, and capacities for such
behaviors, and contextual conditions that constrain behavior.},

This article develops a case study of war resumption in Congo in 2008 to
understand why and how this happened. International peacebuilders took
preventive action in Congo, but not as part of the protection efforts.
Peacebuilders focused on preventing renewed national and regional wars,
and they ignored the local conflicts that fuelled these broader tensions. The
reason for this lies in a dominant culture of international peacebuilding. This
culture shaped international efforts in such a way that the three essential
conditions for effective prevention – political will, early warning and the
preventive toolbox – were present for the prevention of renewed national
and regional fighting but absent for the prevention of local violence. The
resulting strategy allowed a crisis localized in the province of North Kivu to
escalate into a full-scale war. The same type of effect appears generalizable
across several recent interventions.},

& Harris, 1967; Ross, 1977), and our tendency to infer the attitudes of a group
on the basis of the group’s decision, regardless of the group decision rule. 
The
present research focuses on this latter process. What we term the group attribution
error consists of the tendency to assume that group decisions reflect members’
attitudes. This assumption can be erroneous because group decision rules, in
addition to members’ attitudes, can influence group decisions. In Experiment 1,
members of a community in which a water conservation law was or was not
instituted were assumed to have correspondent attitudes, regardless of how the
community decision was made. In Experiments 2 and 3, subjects inferred a
greater correspondence between out-group decisions and out-group attitudes than
between an in-group decision and in-group attitudes. The fourth experiment found
that subjects committed the group attribution error because they attended as
much to the outcome of a recall election as to the actual proportion of voters
for and against the recall. Finally, Experiment 5 showed that subjects’ inferences
of jury members’ attitudes were influenced not only by the final jury vote but
also by the actual decision, which was determined by the vote plus the decision
rule by which the jury was bound. The results are related to previous research
on the fundamental attribution error, stereotyping, and polarized appraisals of
Out-groups.},

attribution of outgroup than ingroup failure to lack of ability, and ‘explaining away’
outgroup success to good luck, high effort or an easy task; (3) A preference for ingroupserving versus outgroup-serving attributions for group differences.

Her key finding: rarely are such conflicts resolved without active third-party intervention.

Walter argues that for negotiations to succeed it is not enough for the opposing sides to resolve the underlying issues behind a civil war. Instead the combatants must clear the much higher hurdle of designing credible guarantees on the terms of agreement--something that is difficult without outside assistance. Examining conflicts from Greece to Laos, China to Columbia, Bosnia to Rwanda, Walter confirms just how crucial the prospect of third-party security guarantees and effective power-sharing pacts can be--and that adversaries do, in fact, consider such factors in deciding whether to negotiate or fight. While taking many other variables into account and acknowledging that third parties must also weigh the costs and benefits of involvement in civil war resolution, this study reveals not only how peace is possible, but probable.},

It can, however, offer its technical expertise in multidimensional peacekeeping operations that follow enforcement missions undertaken by states or regional organizations such as NATO. 

Finding that UN missions are most effective in the first few years after the end of war, and that economic development is the best way to decrease the risk of new fighting in the long run, the authors also argue that the UN's role in launching development projects after civil war should be expanded.},

because the cases in which the United Nations intervened were quite different from
those in which they did not. Therefore the estimated causal effect may be due to the
assumptions of the model that the researchers chose rather than to peacekeeping
itself. The root of the problem is that UN missions are not randomly assigned. 

We argue that standard approaches for dealing with this problem (Heckman regression
and instrumental variables) are invalid and impracticable in the context of UN
peacekeeping and would lead to estimates of the effects of UN operations that are
largely a result of the assumptions of the statistical model rather than the data. 

We correct for the effects of nonrandom assignment with matching techniques on a
sample of UN interventions in post-Cold-War conflicts and find that UN interventions are indeed effective in the sample of post-civil-conflict interventions, but that UN interventions while civil wars are still ongoing have no causal effect},

developing a game model focused on the puzzle of what prevents negotiated settlements to longrunning,
destructive civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an implausible explanation.

undermine the government’s ability to commit.* The commitment problem binds harder when the
center has an enduring political or economic interest in expansion into the periphery, as in ‘sons of the

  abstract  = {Definition
A reputation is a judgment of someone’s character or disposition that is then used to predict or explain
future behavior. Note that a reputation is dispositional and not situational.

Reputation and Rational Deterrence Theory
The central problem in deterrence theory is making threats and promises credible. Credibility rests on
resolve, capability and interests. Mercer argues that capability and interests are situational attributions,
and therefore he focuses only on resolve, as a way to define a reputation.

Three false assumptions of Rational Deterrence Theory
(1) observed behavior is self-evident (everyone must know how the target behaved and must draw the
same inference form that behavior, inferring weakness from weak behavior and strength from strong
behavior).
(2) reputation is a property concept and not a relational concept (since how to interpret a certain
behavior is common knowledge, one can strategically manipulate the perceptions of others and therefore
reputation).
(3) commitments are interdependent (it is assumed that past behavior is always used to predict future
behavior and that future situations are similar to previous ones).
-Mercer contends that these assumptions neglect the fact that reputation is a relational concept. People
interpret a certain observation in many different ways. As for the first two assumptions, you cannot
possibly assume that the others interpret a certain behavior in the same way you think they will.
Therefore, one cannot manipulate or control a reputation As for the third assumption, international
politics rarely resembles an iterated game because the same situation is not going to be repeated and
because the actor’s type is not perfectly correlated across games. Also, whether people use the past to
predict the future behavior should be a question to be examined not an assumption.

Reputation and Social Psychology
-Drawing on social psychology theories, Mercer argues that decision-makers tend to use situational
attributions for desirable behavior, whereas they tend to use character-based attributions for undesirable
behaviors.
-The desirability of a state’s actions rather than expectations plays an important role in determining a
how a country’s behavior will shape its reputation. There is a potential endogeneity problem in theories
which say expectations shape reputation.
-Therefore, we have the following hypotheses: situational explanations will be used to describe desirable
behaviors (ally stands firm and adversary backs down), dispositional explanations will be used to
describe undesirable behaviors (ally backs down and adversary stands firm). See table 3.
-Finally, four propositions are noted: allies rarely gain reputations for resolve whereas adversaries rarely
gain reputations for irresolution.},

academic research on its features and effectiveness. But research that speaks to both the
initiation and implementation of mediation remains relatively rare. This article outlines a
theoretical and empirical argument that contributes to filling this gap and suggests a
counterintuitive selection effect: potential mediators that are likely to resolve a dispute
are unlikely to select into mediation. The argument hinges on the claim that **mediation
by biased third parties is relatively ineffective**, and I provide qualitative evidence to
suggest that this claim is plausible.

"biased mediators are relatively less effective at
resolving disputes than their unbiased counterparts, because only an unbiased
mediator can credibly share conflict-relevant insights."

"My argument that biased mediation is relatively ineffective reflects the relationship
between mediation and the informational setting within which antagonists
operate. While disputants face incentives to avoid costly conflicts, they sometimes
fail to do so because they find themselves unable to agree on what the outcome of
an armed struggle would be (Fearon, 1995)...each disputant possesses private information, for example about battle strength or
resolve, but has incentives to exaggerate in order to extract an advantageous settlement."

"In this situation an unbiased mediator can credibly convey private, conflictrelevant
information that he or she holds, because the disputants know that the
mediator does not care about how exactly the incompatibility between the disputants
is resolved. This is not the case for a biased mediator..."

  abstract  = {We construct a theory of persistent civil conflicts, where persistence is driven by the endogenous
dynamics of inter-ethnic trust and trade. In times of peace, agents belonging to two groups are randomly
matched to trade bilaterally. Trade hinges on trust and cooperation. The onset of conflict signals that the
aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate, harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history of
conflicts and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars are persistent. Moreover,
even accidental conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a society
into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by policies
abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs. Coercive peace
policies, such as peacekeeping forces or externally imposed regime changes, have no enduring effects.

Civil war begets more civil war.  "Imperfect and, possibly, incorrect learning is the source of endogenous
persistence."

"First, policies increasing the profitability of inter-ethnic trade reduce the incidence of conflict. Examples include policies abating barriers, such as educational policies promoting the knowledge of several national languages, or subsidies
for human-capital investments. Second, policies directly targeting people’s held beliefs may be
useful."

"On the contrary, attempts to impose peace through coercion—e.g. peacekeeping forces or
externally imposed regime changes—ultimately have no persistent effects, especially if they fail
to restore trade links. 
**Forcing the separation of groups may even be harmful, since such measures
would stifle any potential for trade cooperation** that otherwise may emerge during peace spells,
and that over time may slowly restore confidence."},

that most contractual relationships—whether for private or public goods—have at

"Rational egoists can be thought of as having intrinsic
payoffs that are the same as objective payoffs, since they do not value the social
norm of reciprocity. Conditional cooperators (to take only one additional type of

additional parameter that adds value to the objective payoffs when reciprocating
trust with trustworthiness."

FRIEDMAN defects from then on. FRIEDMAN did very well with
RANDOM, and since it is nice, it did well with all the other nice rules.
But it did not do well with the kingmakers, because it did not let them
recover from the consequences of their first defection. This brings us
to the important property of forgiveness of a decision rule."

"Forgiveness of a rule is its propensity
to cooperate in the moves after the other player has defected."

"The moral is that if both sides are unforgiving
in the way that JOSS and TIT FOR TAT were, it does not pay to be as
greedy as JOSS was."

"TIT FOR TAT won the tournament. This was the simplest rule
submitted: Cooperate on the first move and then do whatever the other
player did on the previous move. One implication is that reciprocity
is not only a social norm, but can also be an extremely successful operating
rule for an individualistic pragmatist"

"A sophisticated
analysis must go at least three levels deep. First is the direct
effect of a choice. This is easy, since a defection always earns more than
a cooperation. Second are the indirect effects, taking into account that
the other side may or may not punish a defection. This much was certainly
appreciated by many of the entrants. But third is the fact that
in responding to the defections of the other side, one may be repeating
or even amplifying one's own previous exploitative choice. Thus a
single occasional defection may be successful when analyzed for its
direct effects, and perhaps even when its secondary effects are taken
into account. But the real costs may be in the tertiary effects when one's
own isolated defections turn into unending mutual recriminations"

"The sample program sent to prospective contestants to show them how to make
a submission would in fact have won the tournament if anyone had simply clipped
it and mailed it in! But no one did. This rule is to defect only if the other player defected
on the previous two moves. It is a more forgiving version of TIT FOR TAT
in that it does not punish isolated defections. The excellent performance of the TIT
FOR TWO TATS rule highlights the fact that a common error of the contestants
was to expect that gains could be made from being relatively less forgiving than
TIT FOR TAT, whereas in fact there were big gains to be made from being even
more forgiving. The implication of this finding is striking, since it suggests that
expert strategists do not give sufficient weight to the importance of forgiveness"},

"Another characteristic of natural groups,which is absent fromartificial

morality-based groups share convictions about standards and principles
on the distinction between right and wrong, as opposed to attitudes on
matters of taste and preference (good or bad). Importantly, the degree
to which shared moral convictions form the basis of a morality-based
group depends on the existence of a salient outgroup holding opposing
moral convictions (Haidt, 2001). For example, attitudes regarding the
legality of abortion in the United States define distinct morality-based
groups (pro-choice vs. pro-life) on the national level,where the respective
outgroups are highly salient, but not in the context of, e.g., post
graduate democrats, where pro-choice is nearly consensual.5
At the interpersonal level, disagreements onmatters ofmorality are
accompanied by strong emotions, intolerance, a desire for social/
physical distance, lack of goodwill, and little regard for procedural safeguards
(Parker & Janoff-Bulman, 2013). Relying on these results, Parker
and Janoff-Bulman conjecture that this pattern should be relevant to intergroup

**Results of each study indicated that individuals in morality-based groups reported less positive ingroup emotions and more negative outgroup emotions and threat than did those in non-morality-based groups.**

 Additionally, strength of morality-based identification was predicted by attitudes about both the ingroup and the outgroup, but only attitudes about the ingroup predicted identification for non-morality-based groups. Together, these studies suggest a necessary interdependence of ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity for social groups based in morality. We conclude that negative outgroup-related emotions may be just as important as positive ingroup-related emotions for social identification based on moral convictions.},

hypotheses of the theory are then presented with a summary of empirical evidence.
Social implications follow. Reasons for the pervasiveness of the phenomenon
are examined as well as conditions that lead a specific outgroup to be infrahumanized.
We also explore the consequences of infra-humanization, such as
a lack of forgiveness for the outgroup and the ingroup’s justification for past
misdeeds against the outgroup, rather than guilt. Policy issues center on ways to
combat essentialism, walls of difference between groups, and irrational symbols
of superiority. The roles of egalitarian values and of deprovincialized intergroup
contact are emphasized."

“infra-humanization,” or “subhumanization,” but from an etymological point of
view it means something very different. We were interested to show that people
are inclined to perceive members of outgroups as somewhat less human, or
more animal-like, than themselves; such a view corresponds to the word infrahumanization
(although we could also have used “subhumanization”).
By contrast, dehumanization of an outgroup implies that its members are no
longer humans at all. It is this complete deprivation of humanity that explains
why dehumanization is often used in extreme cases such as in armed conflicts,
when others are no longer humans, but vicious animals or dispensable objects
(Bar-Tal, 1989; Staub, 1989). When there is dehumanization, there is “moral
exclusion” (Opotow, 1990) in the sense that people are no longer protected by
values such as morality; they may suffer anything from actors who do not have
moral restraints. Our aim, however, was to show that something of much lesser
magnitude could occur in everyday life.},

  abstract  = {Côte d’Ivoire’s adoption of land privatization policies promoted by the World Bank and European Union is
producing new land use patterns in the countryside. A centerpiece of these policies is the 1998 Rural Land
Law that aims to restructure rural economic life along agrarian capitalist lines. The purported ‘‘development”
objective of land privatization is to stimulate agricultural productivity based on the assumption
that land titling will lead farmers and herders to make greater investments in their production systems.
This paper argues that the mobile livestock raising system of immigrant FulBe pastoralists in Côte d’Ivoire
is threatened by the new land law. Since mobility is crucial to animal health and fertility rates, I argue
that reduced mobility will lead to lower livestock productivity. Although the land law has yet to be implemented,
its very existence is leading prospective claimants to test their land rights by planting orchards
and lending land to immigrant farmers. The monetization of land lending and grazing rights is increasingly
common. Land disputes over who has the power to allocate land are also on the rise. I argue that
this heightened interest in ‘‘tenure building” is constraining herd mobility, especially for herders with
limited resources to negotiate access to rangelands. On the other hand, land privatization is strengthening
the hand of local cattle-owning farmers who increasingly practice mobile livestock raising and compete
with FulBe herders for grazing lands. Under these new conditions of land access, control, and
competition, FulBe herd mobility and productivity are at risk of declining.},

intergroup contact and demographic change is increasingly important to policy and scientic

practical inability to experiment on demographic context have constrained scholars' ability to
speak to the eects of intergroup contact. Here I report the results of an experiment testing
the causal eects of prolonged intergroup contact in which Spanish-speaking confederates
were randomly assigned to be inserted, for an extended period, into the daily routines of
unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus
simulating the conditions of demographic change. The result of this controlled experiment
is a signicant shift toward exclusionary attitudes among treated subjects. However there is
evidence that the initial aversion diminishes over time. This experiment demonstrates that
even very minor demographic change causes strong exclusionary reactions.},

the basic laws of probability. For example, Herb Gintis once offered a plausible
alternative explanation for why the mean offer in the Henrich (2000) UG run
with the Machegeunga in Peru was so low. The published reason has to do with
culture and the low frequency of interacting with strangers. 

While this reasoning
fits well with the other observations from the 15 small scale societies project, a
plausible alternative is that nothing is random to people living in Amazonia.
Henrich flipped a coin to see if each participant was going to be the first-mover
or the second-mover. A coin flip does not mean the same thing to a person who
believes that supernatural forces determine the course of events. Such a person
may think that she was chosen to be the first-mover for a reason, and with that
mindset demanding most of the pie does not seem unreasonable.},

  abstract  = {Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has rejuvenated the social sciences, dramatically
reducing the cost and inconvenience of collecting original data. Recently, however,
researchers have raised concerns about the presence of “non-respondents” (bots) and
non-serious respondents on the platform. Spurred by these concerns, we fielded an
original survey on MTurk to measure response quality. While we find no evidence of
a “bot epidemic,” we do find that a significant portion of survey respondents behaved
suspiciously while taking the survey. About 20% of respondents either circumvented
location requirements or took the survey multiple times, and at least 5-7% of participants
likely engaged in “trolling” or satisficing. Altogether, we find about a quarter of
data collected on MTurk is potentially untrustworthy. Furthermore, we find evidence
suggesting that the prevalence of low quality responses in MTurk data has increased
over time, and that low quality responses are more common on MTurk than on other
online survey platforms. Finally, we find response quality impacts experimental treatments.
On average, low quality responses attenuate treatment effects by approximately
10%. We conclude by providing recommendations for collecting data on MTurk.},

directiveness as a cause of bias. 

After completing questions about physical exercise
on a web survey, respondents completed a text message–based reporting procedure, sending
updates on their major activities for five days. Random assignment was then made to one
of two conditions: instructions mentioned the focus of the study, physical exercise, or not. Survey
responses, text updates, and records from recreation facilities were compared. Direct
measures generated bias—overreporting in survey measures and reactivity in the directive
text condition—but the nondirective text condition generated unbiased measures. Findings
are discussed in terms of identity},

and evaluative dimension the researcher has in mind. Next, they (b) need to retrieve relevant
information from memory. In most cases, a previously formed judgment that meets the specifics of
the question will not be accessible and they have to draw on information that seems relevant to the
question at hand. Relevant information includes features of the attitude object, the respondent's apparent affective response to the object, as well as information about the respondent's own
behavior with regard to the object. Based on this information, respondents (c) need to compute a
judgment. Having formed a judgment, they (d) can rarely report it in their own words but need to
map it onto a set of response alternatives provided by the researcher. Finally, (e) respondents may
want to edit their private judgment before they communicate it to the researcher for reasons of
social desirability and self-presentation. Performance at each of these steps is context dependent,
yet this context dependency has differential implications for the notion that people hold enduring
attitudes.},

Study 1 was a qualitative content analysis of how domestic violence was portrayed in all 23 episodes of DRTS, identifying themes and scenes that could influence viewers’ threat and coping appraisal of domestic violence.  In Study 2, a quantitative content analysis of 1,848 viewer posts spread over an eight-year period was carried out on DRTS’ online forum, ascertaining how they reflected the viewers’ threat and coping appraisal about domestic violence. Study 3 was an on-line survey with Chinese nationals (N=326) that tested how their threat and coping appraisal with respect to domestic violence influenced the relationships between program exposure and three behavioural intention outcomes—i.e., victim coping, bystander intervention, and policy support. Our triangulated results suggested that, overall, DRTS was highly effective in using fear appeals to get the public’s attention on domestic violence, spur public discussions on the topic, and foster a favorable policy climate—one that culminated in 2015 in the passage of anti-domestic violence legislation.},

The participatory experiments were carried out by 101 rice farmers. Although farmers' perceptions of pests and pesticide use were deeply entrenched, the simple experiment reduced their early-season insecticide applications and number of sprays. Farmers attitudes toward leaf-feeding insects also changed. Besides dissonance resolution, the main incentives that had encouraged farmers seemed to be money savings and labor reduction. Few studies in communication, if any, have explored the impact of the use of conflict information on changing farmers' perceptions.

others, especially members of different social or cultural groups. In five experiments, we systematically explore
how social identity, functional relations between groups, competitive threat, and perceived entitativity contribute
to intergroup empathy bias: 

the tendency not only to empathize less with out-group relative to in-group members,
but also to feel pleasure in response to their pain (and pain in response to their pleasure). 

When teams are set in
direct competition, affective responses to competition-irrelevant events are characterized not only by less empathy
toward out-group relative to in-groupmembers, but also by increased counter-empathic responses: Schadenfreude
and Glückschmerz (Experiment 1). Comparing responses to in-group and out-group targets against responses to
unaffiliated targets in this competitive context suggests that intergroup empathy bias may be better characterized
by out-group antipathy rather than extraordinary in-group empathy (Experiment 2). We also find that intergroup
empathy bias is robust to changes in relative group standing—feedback indicating that the out-group has fallen
behind (Experiment 3a) or is no longer a competitive threat (Experiment 3b) does not reduce the bias. However,
reducing perceived in-group and out-group entitativity can significantly attenuate intergroup empathy bias
(Experiment 4). This research establishes the boundary conditions of intergroup empathy bias and provides initial
support for a more integrative framework of group-based empathy},

influence, cognitive processes involved, motivations for being influenced, effects
of minority and majority influence attempts, and the magnitude of influence are
discussed. We then examine indirect evidence for the relevance of social categorization to influence in groups before going on to present an analysis in terms
of social identity and self-categorization theories. Direct tests of the theory in
the areas of conformity, group polarization and norm formation are described
and the discussion then broadens to include other issues which are raised by
alternative formulations. In particular we address the questions of compliance
versus true conformity (or agreement), public and private behaviour, majority

by suggesting some directions for future research.},

separate measures. Although both quantity of positive and negative contact predicted racism and avoidance, negative contact
was the stronger predictor. Furthermore, negative (but not positive) contact independently predicted suspicion about Barack
Obama’s birthplace. These results extend the contact hypothesis by issuing an important caveat: Negative contact may be
more strongly associated with increased racism and discrimination than positive contact is with its reduction.},

late Egyptian leader suggests, are psychological. We explore cognitive and motivational
processes that impede mutually beneficial exchanges of concessions
and render seemingly tractable conflicts refractory to negotiated resolution. In
such cases, we argue, the failure to achieve significant progress represents a kind
of “market inefficiency,” in much the same sense that there is a failure or inefficiency when a motivated buyer and seller are unable to consummate a deal under
conditions where the buyer’s maximum purchase price exceeds the seller’s minimum
selling price.

We shall begin by distinguishing psychological barriers from two other kinds
of impediments-those that are essentially products of strategic calculation and
those that arise from “impersonal” organizational, institutional, or structural
factors having little to do either with calculation or with the psychological biases
exhibited by individual actors. We shall then proceed to a more detailed examination
of five particular psychological barriers that have figured heavily in our own
research and that of our fellow investigators at the Stanford Center on Conflict
and Negotiation (SCCN). Next, we shall examine three broader theoretical perspectives
that speak to sources of resentment, misunderstanding, misattribution,
and distrust in the negotiation process-once again with disproportionate, but
not exclusive, emphasis on our own work and that of our SCCN colleagues (see
Arrow, Mnookin, Ross, Tversky, & Wilson, in press). Finally, we shall explore
some tentative implications for the theory and practice of dispute resolution,
especially for those intrepid third-party facilitators, mediators, or peacemakers
who confront what is surely one of the most important and difficult challenges in
the whole broad spectrum of applied social psychology.},

Studies 1a–1e investigated the sources of negotiators' expectancies, finding evidence of projection and pessimism;
negotiators consistently overestimated the prevalence of people who share their views on deception and
assumed a sizable share of others embrace deceptive tactics. This phenomenon generalized beyond American
samples to Chinese students (Study 1d) and Turkish adults (Study 1e). Study 2 demonstrated that pessimistic
expectancies about others' ethics positively predicted the degree to which negotiators were dishonest, above and
beyond their own stated ethical views, and that it did so across both distributive and integrative negotiations.
Study 3 provided evidence of a causal relationship between expectancies of others' ethical views and dishonest
behavior by manipulating expectancies. Study 4 provided additional evidence of this causal relationship in a
live, dyadic exchange where performance was incentive compatible. Negotiators' deceptive behavior was shaped
by their pessimism about others' ethical standards. We consider the implications of these findings for preventing

People who are high in trait collective self-esteem should be more likely to react to threats to collective self-esteem by derogating outgroups and enhancing the ingroup. In a study using the minimal intergroup paradigm, trait personal and collective self-esteem were measured, and subjects received information about the average performance of their group. Subjects high in collective self-esteem varied their ratings of above-average and below-average scorers on the test in an ingroup-enhancing fashion, whereas those low in collective self-esteem did not. Analyses based on personal self-esteem did not show this interaction. We conclude that collective self-esteem is an individual difference variable that may moderate the attempt to maintain a positive social identity. The relation between collective and personal self-esteem is discussed.},

a sample of American students as a function of degree of in-group legitimacy, self-esteem,
sex, and social dominance orientation within a standard minimal-groups experimental paradigm.
The results are consistent with both social identity theory and much previous research
in this area: The greater the in-group identification, the greater the allocation of
social value in favor of the in-group. The results are also consistent with the expectations
of social dominance theory and show that, even after the effects of gender, self-esteem,
and in-group identification were considered, the greater the social dominance orientation,
the greater the allocation of social value in favor of the in-group. For two of the three
indexes of social value, there was a statistically significant interaction between in-group
identification and social dominance orientation. Subjects showing strong acceptance of
their in-group classification and who had relatively high levels of social dominance orientation
displayed greater in-group bias.},

threats discussed include: realistic threat, symbolic threat, intergroup anxiety, negative
stereotypes, group esteem threat, and distinctiveness threat. We then conducted a
quantitative meta-analysis examining the relationships between various intergroup
threats and outgroup attitudes. The meta-analysis, involving 95 samples, revealed
that 5 different threat types had a positive relationship with negative outgroup attitudes.
Additionally, outgroup status moderated some of these relationships. Implications
andfuture directions are considered.},

"highlight some of the main features of the competitive ptocess,
those that tend to perpetuate and escalate conflict. Typically, a competitive
process tends to produce the following effects:
1. Communication between the conflicting parties is unreliable and
impoverished.
2. It stimulates the view that the solution of the conflict can only
be imposed by one side or the other by means of superior force, deception,
or cleverness.
3. It leads to a suspicious, hostile attitude that increases the sensitivity
to differences and threats while minimizing the awareness of
similarities.

Misjudgment and misperception. In our preceding discussion of the
effects of competition, it was evident that impoverished communication,
hostile attitudes, and oversensitivity to differences could lead to
distorted views of the other that could intensify and perpetuate conflict...
Many of these misperceptions function to transform a conflict, even if the conflict did not emerge from
a competitive relationship."},

inferential account that specifies the inferences underlying the effects and how these inferences are formed. We draw on
predictive processing theories to explain the basic processes underlying inferential reasoning and their main characteristics.

We find that white students at a large state university randomly assigned African American roommates in their first year were more likely to endorse affirmative action and view a diverse student body as essential for a high-quality education. They were also more likely to say they have more personal contact with, and interact more comfortably with, members of minority groups. Although sample sizes are too small to provide definitive evidence, these results suggest students become more empathetic with the social groups to which their roommates belong. },

  abstract  = {This study examined the effect of living with White, Asian American, Latino, or African American roommates on affective, cognitive, and behavioral indicators of prejudice among university students. We used a five-wave panel study with approximately 2000 students to examine the effect of roommate contact in two ways: First, through a field experimental test by examining prejudice as a function of living with randomly assigned roommates during the first year of university. Second, net of pre-existing attitudes, we examined the effects of voluntary roommate contact during the second and third year of university on fourth year prejudice. Consistent with contact theory, both randomly assigned and voluntary contact decreased prejudice. Also, there was generalization to other outgroups, particularly from Black roommates to Latinos, and vice versa. Finally, an interesting exception was found for contact with Asian American roommates, whether randomly assigned or voluntary, which tended to make attitudes towards other groups more negative. Potential explanations for this result are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The article presents a conceptual framework that concerns the sociopsychological
foundation and dynamics of intractable conflict. First, it defines and characterizes the nature
of intractable conflict, and then it describes how societies involved in this reality adapt to
the conditions of intractable conflict. This adaptation meets three fundamental challenges:
satisfying the needs of the society members, coping with stress, and withstanding the rival.
In trying to confront them successfully, societies develop appropriate sociopsychological
infrastructure, which includes collective memory, ethos of conflict, and collective emotional
orientations. This infrastructure fulfills important individual and collective level functions,
including the important role of formation, maintenance, and strengthening of a social
identity that reflects this conflict. Special attempts are made to disseminate this
infrastructure via societal channels of communication and institutionalize it. The evolved
sociopsychological infrastructure becomes a prism through which society members
construe their reality, collect new information, interpret their experiences, and make
decisions about their course of action. This infrastructure becomes hegemonic, rigid, and
resistant to change as long as the intractable conflict continues. It ends up serving as a major
factor fueling the continuation of the conflict, thus becoming part of a vicious cycle of
intractable conflict.},

  abstract  = {This paper reviews the research on cooperative learning methods, with an emphasis on understanding the complex changes that occur in both classroom organization and student friendship patterns when cooperative, integrated learning groups are used in the desegregated classroom. Cooperative learning methods explicitly use the strength of the desegregated school and the presence of students of different races or ethnicities, to enhance intergroup relations and other outcomes. 

Results of studies relating cooperative learning to intergroup relations clearly indicate that when students work in ethnically mixed cooperative-learning groups, they gain in cross-ethnic friendships. This research indicates that the effects of cooperative learning on intergroup relations are strong and lasting. Practical implications of these findings are unambiguously supportive of implementing contact theory in the desegregated classroom.},

This review integrates research findings from different fields into a theoretical framework that can account for when prosocial behavior is likely to occur. Specifically, we propose that the motivation to cooperate is generated by the reward system in the brain (extending from striatum to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex), and that it can be modulated by two neural networks: a cognitive control system (centered on the lateral prefrontal cortex) that processes extrinsic cooperative incentives, and/or a social cognition system (including the superior temporal sulcus, the anterior medial frontal cortex and the amygdala) that processes trust signals. The independent modulatory influence of incentives and trust on the decision to cooperate is substantiated by a growing body of neuroimaging data and reconciles the apparent paradox between economic versus social rationality in the literature, suggesting that we are in fact wired for both. Furthermore, the theoretical framework can account for substantial behavioral heterogeneity in prosocial behavior. Based on the existing data, we further postulate that self-regarding individuals (who are more likely to adopt an economically rational strategy) are more responsive to extrinsic cooperative incentives and therefore rely relatively more on cognitive control to make (un)cooperative decisions, whereas other-regarding individuals (who are more likely to adopt a socially rational strategy) are more sensitive to trust signals to avoid betrayal and recruit relatively more brain activity in the social cognition system.},

First, the
evolution of social learning (particularly conformist and prestige biases) leads to the
establishment of local and distinct cultural groups (conventionalism). Second, local
cultural rules solve coordination dilemmas by transforming these rules into normative
standards against which others are evaluated (authoritarian submission). Third, the
common rules within a particular culture or group are reinforced by a tendency to
reward norm compliance and punish norm deviations (authoritarian aggression).

 robust triggers of ‘out-group hate’. Here, we present a controlled laboratory experiment,
 which demonstrates that ‘out-group hate’ can be provoked systematically. We find direct and
 causal evidence that the intention to protect the in-group is not only a crucial motivator of
 ‘out-group hate’ in defensive reactions, but also promotes preemptive offensive actions
 against out-group threat. Hence, the strength of ‘out-group hate’ depends on whether the own
 group is perceived to be on the offensive or the defensive side of the conflict. This finding
 improves our understanding of the escalation of intergroup conflicts and may have important
implications for their prevention, as we find in our experiment that removing out-group threat
 substantially reduces intergroup aggression, leading to full peace.},

are in-group bounded and, sometimes, motivated by the desire to ward-off and

love: the tendency to cooperate with and extend trust toward those others who
are similar, familiar rather than unfamiliar, and belong to one’s own group; and (2) outgroup
hate: a willingness to fight against rivaling out-groups. This chapter reviews our
own work, and that of others, showing that parochial cooperation (1) emerges especially
when it benefits individuals’ within-group reputation, (2) affects one’s withingroup
status, (3) is more prominent among individuals with chronic prosocial rather
than proself value orientation, and (4) is sustained and motivated by oxytocin, an evolutionary
ancient hypothalamic neuropeptide pivotal in social bonding, pair–bond formation,
and empathic responding. Across the board, findings resonate well with
relatively recent evolutionary theory on (inter)group relations and add to classic theory
in social psychology.},

when they trigger heuristics or cognitive biases that have been
shaped by natural selection to help people solve problems related to
social exchange (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992; Haselton and Nettle,

The methods that have been proposed often incur costs that (more than) destroy the efficiency gains through increased cooperation. It has for example been shown that inter-group conflict increases intra-group cooperation, however at the cost of collective efficiency. We propose a new method that makes use of the positive effects associated with inter-group competition but avoids the detrimental (cost) effects of a structural conflict. We show that the mere comparison to another structurally independent group increases both the level of intra-group cooperation and overall efficiency. The advantage of this new method is that it directly transfers the benefits from increased cooperation into increased efficiency. In repeated public goods provision we experimentally manipulated the participants’ level of contribution feedback (intra-group only vs. both intra- and inter-group) as well as the provision environment (smaller groups with higher individual benefits from cooperation vs. larger groups with lower individual benefits from cooperation). Irrespective of the provision environment groups with an inter-group comparison opportunity exhibited a significantly stronger cooperation than groups without this opportunity. Participants conditionally cooperated within their group and additionally acted to advance their group to not fall behind the other group. The individual efforts to advance the own group cushion the downward trend in the above average contributors and thus render contributions on a higher level. We discuss areas of practical application.},

resources to group decisions versus by free riding on the contributions of other members. In contrast to
most public-goods games that assume group returns are linear in individual contributions, the present
model assumes decreasing marginal group production as a function of aggregate individual contributions.
This diminishing marginal returns assumption is more realistic and generates starkly different predictions
compared to the linear model. One important implication is that, under most conditions, there exist
equilibria where some, but not all, members of a group contribute, even with completely self-interested
motives. An agent-based simulation confirmed the individual and group advantages of the equilibria in
which behavioral asymmetry emerges from a game structure that is a priori perfectly symmetric for all
agents (all agents have the same payoff function and action space but take different actions in equilibria).
A behavioral experiment demonstrated that cooperators and free riders coexist in a stable manner in
groups performing with the nonlinear production function. A collateral result demonstrated that, compared to a dictatorial decision scheme guided by the best member in a group, the majority/plurality
decision rules can pool information effectively and produce greater individual net welfare at equilibrium,
even if free riding is not sanctioned. This is an original proof that cooperation in ad hoc decision-making
groups can be understood in terms of self-interested motivations and that, despite the free-rider problem,
majority/plurality decision rules can function robustly as simple, efficient social decision heuristics.},

contribute to the group’s success in these conflicts. However, the few empirical
attempts to test this hypothesis do not use natural groups and conflate
measures of in-group and unbiased cooperative behaviour. We conducted
field experiments based on naturalistic measures of cooperation (school/
charity donations and lost letters’ returns) with two religious groups with
an on-going history of conflict—Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland.
Conflict was associated with reduced donations to out-group schools and the
return of out-group letters, but we found no evidence that it influences ingroup cooperation. Rather, socio-economic status was the major determinant
of cooperative behaviour. Our study presents a challenge to dominant perspectives on the origins of human cooperation, and has implications for
initiatives aiming to promote conflict resolution and social cohesion.},

to succeed, members of the same group have incentives to cooperate with each other by
expending individual efforts. However, since effort is costly, each member also has an incentive
to abstain from expending any effort and instead free-ride on the efforts of other members.
Contest theory shows that the intensity of competition between groups and the amount of freeriding
within groups depend on the group size, sharing rule, group impact function, contest
success function, and heterogeneity of players. We review experimental studies testing these
theoretical predictions. Almost all studies of behavior in group contests find significant overexpenditure
of effort relative to the theory. We discuss potential explanations for such overexpenditure,
including the utility of winning, bounded rationality, relative payoff maximization,
parochial altruism, and social identity. Despite over-expenditure, most studies find support for
the comparative statics predictions of the theory (with the exception of the “group size
paradox”). Finally, studies show that there are effective mechanisms that can promote withingroup
cooperation and conflict resolution mechanisms that can de-escalate and potentially
eliminate between-group conflict.},

centralized leadership systems. This claim has important implications, but little direct
support. This research investigates how intergroup conflict shapes individuals’ tendencies
to sacrifice for their groups, enforce norms by sanctioning their peers, and relinquish decision-
making autonomy to a leader. I test the predictions with two small group experiments,
which find that conflict increases enforcement of norms when outgroup participation in conflict
is high and increases contribution to the group regardless of outgroup participation in
conflict. Evidence on support for leaders is mixed and suggests that the performance of the
group may affect support for leaders.},

effects on reconciliation only in the presence of a basic level of
trust in the outgroup. In two studies, Israeli-Jewish participants
were exposed to a Palestinian leader who either expressed or did
not express empathy and/or Palestinian responsibility for Israelis’
suffering. After reading the speech, participants completed a
questionnaire that measured their attitudes toward reconciliation
with Palestinians. Results of both studies show that whereas
expression of empathy led to more positive attitudes when trust
was high, it tended to have adverse effects when trust was low.

  abstract = {Reactive devaluation is a psychological bias that affects the support for a proposal offered by an antagonist in negotiations. Previous work identified reactive devaluation in the context of the Cold War (Stillinger, et al., 1990) and the Israel-Palestinian conflict (Maoz, et al., 2002). Both studies identified the tendency of respondents to negatively evaluate proposals based on antagonistic authorship; however, both studies were conducted in the context of a high threat/low trust situation. Without a variance in the psychological context, it becomes difficult to isolate the causal mechanisms which trigger reactive devaluation. We improve upon this literature by testing the phenomenon of reactive devaluation in the context of the Iranian nuclear deal (perceived to be a low threat situation by respondents), and explore the impact of trust and fear upon the tendency of respondents to reactively devalue the terms of the proposal. We fin d that threat level affects the willingness to accept a peace proposal and that reactive devaluation continues to operate even in the absence of an existential threat. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, threat level or trust in the antagonist does not indirectly condition the effect of reactive devaluation in a significant manner.},

The current status of realistic group conflict theory is evaluated in terms of its theoretical structure, scientific rigor, and ability to fulfill theoretical functions. Finally, some future directions for the theory are outlined. It is concluded that the theory and its underlying philosophy have much to offer to efforts to reduce current and prevent future eruptions of intergroup hostilities.},

about the relationship between these sources of uncertainty and the possibility of peaceful resolution of conflict. Among our
results, we show that under some weak conditions, there is no equilibrium of any crisis bargaining game that has voluntary
agreements and zero probability of costly war. We also show that while uncertainty about the other side’s cost of war may
be relatively benign in peace negotiations, uncertainty about the other side’s strength in war makes it much more difficult
to guarantee peaceful outcomes. Along the way, we are able to assess the degree to which particular modeling assumptions
found in the existing literature drive the well-known relationship between uncertainty, the incentive to misrepresent, and
costly war. We find that while the theoretical connection between war and uncertainty is quite robust to relaxing many
modeling assumptions, whether uncertainty is about costs or the probability of victory remains important},
